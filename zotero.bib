This fact conspires with an aging population in many countries to make rigorous assessment for frailty increasingly important for hematologic oncologists. In this review, we first define frailty and its relevance for patients with hematologic malignancy. Next, we review current data regarding the effect of domains of frailty on outcomes for blood cancers including myelodysplastic syndromes, acute leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphomas such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and multiple myeloma. Finally, after presenting assessment and treatment options for the practicing hematologist, we propose elements of a new research agenda for geriatric hematology: the exchange of age limits for rigorous frailty screening, development of disease-specific measures, and inclusion of functional and patient-reported outcomes alongside survival.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adipose tissues (AT) are highly metabolically active complex endocrine organs and are classified into white (WAT) and brown AT (BAT) with proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory characteristics. The current study investigated the accuracy of computed tomography (CT) to quantitatively detect BAT and WAT based on Hounsfield unit (HU) threshold compared to standardized uptake values (SUVs) of corresponding AT with the use of positron emission tomography (PET). METHODS: One hundred twenty-four patients who underwent whole-body (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) PET/CT were studied. The SUVs and HUs of regions of BAT and WAT were measured and compared in these scans. The receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to detect the HU threshold values for the detection of BAT and WAT. RESULTS: The CT HU of BAT, with high (18)F-FDG uptake, was significantly higher compared to WAT (-67.1~{$\pm~$}8.2 [-10 to -87] versus -93.5~{$\pm~$}10.1 [-88 to -190], P~=~.0006). Generalized linear-regression models revealed that mean CT HU of BAT was 26.4 HU higher than that of WAT (P~=~.001). A strong agreement between CT HU and PET SUV in measuring metabolically active AT (r(2)~=~0.81, P~=~.0001) was observed. The ROC curve showed that the optimal cutoff value of CT HU to detect BAT was HU~{$\geq$}-87 with sensitivity of 83.3\% and specificity of 100\%, and the negative CT HU below -87 is highly specific for WAT. CONCLUSION: In our study, CT can accurately and quantitatively detect BAT and WAT based on CT HU threshold, which is -10 to -87 for~BAT and -88 to -190 for WAT.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Preoperative therapy for localized gastric cancer has considerable appeal. We hypothesized that, in a cooperative group setting, preoperative chemoradiotherapy would induce a 20\% pathologic complete response (pathCR) rate. Combined-modality therapy quality, survival, and safety were secondary end points. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with localized gastric adenocarcinoma were eligible. A negative laparoscopic evaluation was required. Patients received two cycles of induction fluorouracil, leucovorin, and cisplatin followed by concurrent radiation and chemotherapy (infusional fluorouracil and weekly paclitaxel). Resection was attempted 5 to 6 weeks after chemoradiotherapy was completed. Quality of therapy was assessed with other end points. RESULTS: Twenty institutions participated. Forty-nine patients were entered and 43 were assessable (12\% stage IB; 37\% stage II; and 52\% stage III). The pathCR and R0 resection rates were 26\% and 77\%, respectively. At 1 year, more patients with pathCR (82\%) are living than those with less than pathCR (69\%). Grade 4 toxicity occurred in 21\% of patients. Chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery per protocol (including acceptable variations) occurred in 98\%, 44\%, and 63\% of patients, respectively. A D2 dissection was performed in 50\% of patients. Of 18 major radiotherapy variations, 17 were due to the lack of inclusion of the L3-4 vertebral interphase as prespecified. CONCLUSION: For localized gastric cancer, preoperative chemoradiotherapy strategy achieved a pathCR rate of more than 20\% in a cooperative group setting. The quality of surgery improved (50\% with D2 dissection) possibly because surgery was part of this trial. With some refinements, this preoperative chemoradiotherapy strategy is poised for a randomized comparison with postoperative adjuvant chemoradiotherapy in patients with gastric cancer.},

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of hospitalized patients with a primary diagnosis of colorectal cancer between 2007 and 2011 using data from Nationwide Inpatient Sample. ICD-9 codes were used to capture primary diagnosis, surgical procedures, and health outcomes during hospitalization. We used logistic regression analysis to determine racial and socio-economic predictors of surgery type, post-surgical complications and mortality, and linear regression analysis to assess hospital length of stay. RESULTS: A total of 122,631 patients were admitted with a primary diagnosis of malignant colorectal cancer between 2007 and 2011. Of these, 17,327 (14.13~\%) had laparoscopic surgery, 70,328 (57.35~\%) received open surgery, while 34976 (28.52~\%) did not receive any surgery. Black (36~\%) and Hispanic (34~\%) patients were more likely to receive no surgery compared with Whites (27~\%) patients. However, among patients that received any surgery, there were no racial differences in which surgery was received (laparoscopic versus open, p\,=\,0.2122), although socio-economic differences remained, with patients from lower residential income areas significantly less likely to receive laparoscopic surgery compared with patients from higher residential income areas (OR: 0.74, 95~\% CI: 0.70-0.78). Among patients who received any surgery, Black patients (OR\,=\,1.07, 95~\% CI: 1.01-1.13), and patients with Medicare (OR\,=\,1.16, 95 \% CI: 1.11-1.22) and Medicaid (OR\,=\,1.15, 95~\% CI: 1.07-1.25) insurance experienced significantly higher post-surgical complications, in-hospital mortality (Black OR\,=\,1.18, 95~\% CI: 1.00-1.39), and longer hospital stay (Black {$\beta$}\,=\,1.33, 95~\% CI: 1.16-1.50) compared with White patients or patients with private insurance.

This study reports on the safety and efficacy of the docetaxel-based triplet FLOT (fluorouracil plus leucovorin, oxaliplatin and docetaxel) as a perioperative therapy for patients with locally advanced, resectable tumours. METHODS: In this controlled, open-label, phase 2/3 trial, we randomly assigned 716 patients with histologically-confirmed advanced clinical stage cT2 or higher or nodal positive stage (cN+), or both, resectable tumours, with no evidence of distant metastases, via central interactive web-based-response system, to receive either three pre-operative and three postoperative 3-week cycles of 50 mg/m2 epirubicin and 60 mg/m2 cisplatin on day 1 plus either 200 mg/m2 fluorouracil as continuous intravenous infusion or 1250 mg/m2 capecitabine orally on days 1 to 21 (ECF/ECX; control group) or four preoperative and four postoperative 2-week cycles of 50 mg/m2 docetaxel, 85 mg/m2 oxaliplatin, 200 mg/m2 leucovorin and 2600 mg/m2 fluorouracil as 24-h infusion on day 1 (FLOT; experimental group). The primary outcome of the trial was overall survival (superiority) analysed in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01216644. FINDINGS: Between Aug 8, 2010, and Feb 10, 2015, 716 patients were randomly assigned to treatment in 38 German hospitals or with practice-based oncologists. 360 patients were assigned to ECF/ECX and 356 patients to FLOT. Overall survival was increased in the FLOT group compared with the ECF/ECX group (hazard ratio [HR] 0{$\cdot$}77; 95\% confidence interval [CI; 0.63 to 0{$\cdot$}94]; median overall survival, 50 months [38{$\cdot$}33 to not reached] vs 35 months [27{$\cdot$}35 to 46{$\cdot$}26]). The number of patients with related serious adverse events (including those occurring during hospital stay for surgery) was similar in the two groups (96 [27\%] in the ECF/ECX group vs 97 [27\%] in the FLOT group), as was the number of toxic deaths (two [{$<$}1\%] in both groups). Hospitalisation for toxicity occurred in 94 patients (26\%) in the ECF/ECX group and 89 patients (25\%) in the FLOT group. INTERPRETATION: In locally advanced, resectable gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, perioperative FLOT improved overall survival compared with perioperative ECF/ECX.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The evidence that body composition parameters influence multiple cancer outcomes is rapidly expanding. Excess adiposity deposits in muscle tissue, termed myosteatosis, can be detected in CT scans through variations in the density of muscle tissues (Hounsfield Units). Patients with similar muscle mass but different amounts of intramuscular adipose infiltration have increased chemotherapy toxicity, time to tumor progression and other adverse outcomes among different cancer types. Our review examines the impact of myosteatosis on overall survival (OS) in patients with cancer. METHODS: A systematic search of the literature was conducted on PubMed/ MEDLINE, Cochrane CENTRAL, and EMBASE. Meta-analysis was conducted using a random-effects model. Risk of bias was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality assessment for cohort studies, funnel plot (publication bias), and GRADE summary of findings tool from Cochrane. RESULTS: A total of 4880 articles were screened from which 40 articles selected, including 21,222 patients. The overall mean proportion of patients with myosteatosis was 48 \% (range 11-85 \%). Using skeletal muscle density (SMD), patients classified as having myosteatosis had 75 \% greater mortality risk compared to non-myosteatosis patients (HR 1.75 95 \% CI 1.60-1.92, 40 studies) (p {$<$} .00001) (i2 = 62 \%). Specifically, myosteatosis was prognostic for worse OS in patients with gynecological, renal, periampullary/pancreatic, hepatocellular, gastroesophageal, and colorectal carcinoma, and lymphomas. CONCLUSION: Our analysis of the literature shows that cancer patients with myosteatosis have shorter survival. Our findings suggest that in oncological practice, muscle density assessment is valuable as a prognostic parameter.},

Data from one prospective and one retrospective study were used to determine if the highest doses of oxaliplatin/kg LBM within FOLFOX regimens would be associated with dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in colon cancer patients. Toxicity over four cycles was graded according to NCI Common Toxicity Criteria V2 or V3 (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD). Muscle tissue was measured by computerized tomography (CT) and used to evaluate the LBM compartment of the whole body. In prospective randomized clinical trials conducted in France (n = 58), for patients given FOLFOX-based regimens according to body surface area, values of oxaliplatin/kg LBM were highly variable, ranging from 2.55 to 6.6 mg/kg LBM. A cut point of 3.09 mg oxaliplatin/kg LBM for developing toxicity was determined by Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis, below this value 0/17 (0.0\%) of patients experienced DLT; in contrast above this value 18/41 (44.0\%) of patients were dose reduced or had treatment terminated owing to toxicity ({$\geq$}Grade 3 or neuropathy {$\geq$}Grade 2); for 9/41 the DLT was sensory neuropathy. These findings were validated in an independent cohort of colon cancer patients (n = 80) receiving FOLFOX regimens as part of standard care, in Canada. Low LBM is a significant predictor of toxicity and neuropathy in patients administered FOLFOX-based regimens using conventional body surface area (BSA) dosing.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Muscle wasting (Sarcopenia) is associated with poor outcomes in cancer patients. Early identification of sarcopenia can facilitate nutritional and exercise intervention. Cross-sectional skeletal muscle (SM) area at the third lumbar vertebra (L3) slice of a computed tomography (CT) image is increasingly used to assess body composition and calculate SM index (SMI), a validated surrogate marker for sarcopenia in cancer. Manual segmentation of SM requires multiple steps, which limits use in routine clinical practice. This project aims to develop an automatic method to segment L3 muscle in CT scans. METHODS: Attenuation correction CTs from full body PET-CT scans from patients enrolled in two prospective trials were used. The training set consisted of 66 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who underwent curative intent radiotherapy. An additional 42 NSCLC patients prescribed curative intent chemo-radiotherapy from a second trial were used for testing. Each patient had multiple CT scans taken at different time points prior to and post- treatment (147 CTs in the training and validation set and 116 CTs in the independent testing set). Skeletal muscle at L3 vertebra was manually segmented by two observers, according to the Alberta protocol to serve as ground truth labels. This included 40 images segmented by both observers to measure inter-observer variation. An ensemble of 2.5D fully convolutional neural networks (U-Nets) was used to perform the segmentation. The final layer of U-Net produced the binary classification of the pixels into muscle and non-muscle area. The model performance was calculated using Dice score and absolute percentage error (APE) in skeletal muscle area between manual and automated contours. RESULTS: We trained five 2.5D U-Nets using 5-fold cross validation and used them to predict the contours in the testing set. The model achieved a mean Dice score of 0.92 and an APE of 3.1\% on the independent testing set. This was similar to inter-observer variation of 0.96 and 2.9\% for mean Dice and APE respectively. We further quantified the performance of sarcopenia classification using computer generated skeletal muscle area. To meet a clinical diagnosis of sarcopenia based on Alberta protocol the model achieved a sensitivity of 84\% and a specificity of 95\%. CONCLUSIONS: This work demonstrates an automated method for accurate and reproducible segmentation of skeletal muscle area at L3. This is an efficient tool for large scale or routine computation of skeletal muscle area in cancer patients which may have applications on low quality CTs acquired as part of PET/CT studies for staging and surveillance of patients with cancer.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: There is increasing use of computed tomography (CT) in sarcopenia research using a wide variety of techniques. We performed a systematic review of the CT literature to identify the differences between approaches used. METHODS: A comprehensive search of PubMed from 1983 to 2017 was performed to identify studies that used CT muscle measurements to assess muscle mass and myosteatosis. The CT protocols were evaluated based on anatomic landmark(s), thresholding, muscle(s) segmented, key measurement (ie, muscle attenuation, cross-sectional area, volume), derived variables, and analysis software. From the described search, 657 articles were identified and 388 studies met inclusion criteria for this systematic review. RESULTS: Muscle mass was more commonly assessed than myosteatosis (330 vs. 125). The most commonly assessed muscle or muscle groups were total abdominal wall musculature (142/330 and 49/125 for muscle mass and myosteatosis, respectively) and total thigh musculature (90/330 and 48/125). The most commonly used landmark in the abdomen was the L3 vertebra (123/142 and 45/49 for muscle mass and myosteatosis, respectively). Skeletal muscle index and intermuscular adipose tissue were the most commonly used measures of abdominal wall muscle mass (114/142) and myosteatosis (27/49), respectively. Cut points varied across studies. A significant majority of studies failed to report important CT technical parameters, such as use of intravenous contrast and slice thickness (94\% and 63\%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: There is considerable variation in the CT approaches used for the assessment of muscle mass and myosteatosis. There is a need to develop consensus for CT-based evaluation of sarcopenia and myosteatosis.},

  abstract = {Oesophageal cancer is a debilitating disease with a poor prognosis, and weight loss owing to malnutrition prevails in the majority of patients. Cachexia, a multifactorial syndrome characterized by the loss of fat and skeletal muscle mass and systemic inflammation arising from complex host-tumour interactions is a major contributor to malnutrition, which is a determinant of tolerance to treatment and survival. In patients with oesophageal cancer, cachexia is further compounded by eating difficulties owing to the stage and location of the tumour, and the effects of neoadjuvant therapy. Treatment with curative intent involves exceptionally extensive and invasive surgery, and the subsequent anatomical changes often lead to eating difficulties and severe postoperative malnutrition. Thus, screening for cachexia by means of percentage weight loss and BMI during the cancer trajectory and survivorship periods is imperative. Additionally, markers of inflammation (such as C-reactive protein), dysphagia and appetite loss should be assessed at diagnosis. Routine assessments of body composition are also necessary in patients with oesophageal cancer to enable assessment of skeletal muscle loss, which might be masked by sarcopenic obesity in these patients. A need exists for clinical trials examining the effectiveness of therapeutic and physical-activity-based interventions in mitigating muscle loss and counteracting cachexia in these patients.},

The aim of this prospective cohort study was to asssess the influence of eating difficulties and severe weight loss on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) up to 10\,years after oesophagectomy. METHODS: Data on bodyweight and HRQoL were collected at 6\,months, 3, 5 and 10\,years in patients who underwent surgery for oesophageal cancer in Sweden between 2001 and 2005. Exposures were percentage weight loss, and eating difficulties defined by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-OES18 questionnaire. Outcomes were HRQoL scores from the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. Repeated-measures ANOVA, adjusting for potential confounders, was used to assess the association between eating difficulties and weight loss (4 exposure groups) and HRQoL scores at each time point. Mean score differences (MDs) between time points or exposure groups were defined as clinically relevant in accordance with evidence-based interpretation guidelines. RESULTS: In total, 92 of 104 10-year survivors (88{$\cdot$}5 per cent) responded to the questionnaires. Weight loss was greatest within 6\,months of surgery. Patients with eating difficulties with or without weight loss reported clinically and statistically significantly worsened HRQoL in almost all aspects. The largest MD was seen between 5 and 10\,years after surgery for global quality of life, physical, role and social function (MD -22 to -30), as well for fatigue, nausea, dyspnoea, insomnia, appetite loss and diarrhoea (MD 24-36). CONCLUSION: Eating difficulties are associated with deterioration in several aspects of HRQoL up to 10\,years after surgery for oesophageal cancer.},

The efficacy of PD-1 blockade as compared with chemotherapy as first-line therapy for MSI-H-dMMR advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer is unknown. METHODS: In this phase 3, open-label trial, 307 patients with metastatic MSI-H-dMMR colorectal cancer who had not previously received treatment were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive pembrolizumab at a dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks or chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil-based therapy with or without bevacizumab or cetuximab) every 2 weeks. Patients receiving chemotherapy could cross over to pembrolizumab therapy after disease progression. The two primary end points were progression-free survival and overall survival. RESULTS: At the second interim analysis, after a median follow-up (from randomization to data cutoff) of 32.4 months (range, 24.0 to 48.3), pembrolizumab was superior to chemotherapy with respect to progression-free survival (median, 16.5 vs. 8.2 months; hazard ratio, 0.60; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.45 to 0.80; P\,=\,0.0002). The estimated restricted mean survival after 24 months of follow-up was 13.7 months (range, 12.0 to 15.4) as compared with 10.8 months (range, 9.4 to 12.2). As of the data cutoff date, 56 patients in the pembrolizumab group and 69 in the chemotherapy group had died. Data on overall survival were still evolving (66\% of required events had occurred) and remain blinded until the final analysis. An overall response (complete or partial response), as evaluated with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1, was observed in 43.8\% of the patients in the pembrolizumab group and 33.1\% in the chemotherapy group. Among patients with an overall response, 83\% in the pembrolizumab group, as compared with 35\% of patients in the chemotherapy group, had ongoing responses at 24 months. Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurred in 22\% of the patients in the pembrolizumab group, as compared with 66\% (including one patient who died) in the chemotherapy group. CONCLUSIONS: Pembrolizumab led to significantly longer progression-free survival than chemotherapy when received as first-line therapy for MSI-H-dMMR metastatic colorectal cancer, with fewer treatment-related adverse events.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Studies over the past 10\,years strongly support an association between skeletal muscle mass (SMM) depletion and outcome in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Factors influencing SMM changes over time are, however, poorly studied. We analyzed the impact of SMM on overall survival and chemotherapy toxicities in mCRC patients treated with first-line chemotherapy. Changes in weight and body composition were evaluated during follow-up. METHODS: Patients enrolled in the randomized phase II ACCORD trial comparing two chemotherapy regimens were screened. Body composition parameters (SMM, adipose tissue) were assessed prospectively with computed tomography (CT) imaging, and toxicities were recorded. Mixed models were used to assess weight and BC changes during 4\,months of treatment follow-up. RESULTS: Among 145 patients included in ACCORD, 76 had available baseline CT scans and were included in the current study. Mean age was 60.6\,{$\pm$}\,10.0\,years, 50\% were women, 82\% had colon cancer, and 62\% had two or more metastatic sites. At baseline, 49\% had lost at least 5\% of their initial weight, including 26\% who had lost more than 10\%; 53\% had SMM depletion. In this homogenous cohort, there were no statistically significant associations between SMM depletion and overall survival, progression-free survival or chemotherapy toxicity. There were no decreases in weight or SMM during follow-up. Weight and SMM changes were not influenced by diarrhea either grade 3-4 or any grade (reported in 74\% of patients). For patients with weight loss {$\geq$}10\% at baseline, SMM increased significantly after 4\,months of follow-up and after disease stabilization following chemotherapy (P\,=\,0.008). CONCLUSIONS: In a homogenous mCRC cohort, SMM depletion was not associated with survival or chemotherapy toxicity. Despite most patient experiencing diarrhea, no changes in weight or SMM were found during 4\,months of follow-up. However, hypotheses deriving from our exploratory study have to be tested in further larger sample size studies. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00423696 (2011).},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several database studies report a lack of care in elderly patients with colorectal cancer. PURPOSE: To describe the management of elderly patients admitted for colorectal cancer; to identify factors associated with standard management according to recommendations and to study factors influencing the survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All consecutive patients over 75 years managed for a colorectal adenocarcinoma in our hospital from 1995 to 2000 and followed until 2006 were retrospectively included. The appropriateness of the management of their disease according to the recommendations available at that time was assessed. Several risk factors in receiving the standard cancer treatment were tested using univariate and then multivariate logistic regression. Risk factors of survival were studied using univariate and then multivariate survival analysis. RESULTS: One hundred and ten patients were included. Median age was 82 years (range: 75-96). A surgical treatment was performed in 96 patients. The median overall survival was 32 (1-108) months. A standard cancer treatment according to recommendations was performed in 53 (48\%) patients: adjuvant chemotherapy in 6/23 patients with stage III tumour, palliative chemotherapy in 3/18 patients with stage IV tumour and adjuvant radiotherapy in 4/14 patients who had a rectal tumour resection. Multivariate analysis retains tumour stage I or II (OR=7.6, 95\% C.I.=[2.9-19.9], p{$<$}0.0001) as the only factor associated with standard treatment and presence of metastasis (HR=3.9, 95\% C.I.

CONCLUSIONS: Fifty two percent of elderly patients have had a sub-standard cancer treatment. The majority had a surgical treatment, but only a few received chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Metastasis, older age and Charlson's comorbidity score are the main prognosis factors of poor survival.},

  abstract = {Cancers are among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and the number of new cases is expected to rise significantly over the next decades. At the same time, all types of cancer treatment, such as surgery, radiation therapy, and pharmacological therapies are improving in sophistication, precision and in the power to target specific characteristics of individual cancers. Thus, while many cancers may still not be cured they may be converted to chronic diseases. All of these treatments, however, are impeded or precluded by the frequent development of malnutrition and metabolic derangements in cancer patients, induced by the tumor or by its treatment. These evidence-based guidelines were developed to translate current best evidence and expert opinion into recommendations for multi-disciplinary teams responsible for identification, prevention, and treatment of reversible elements of malnutrition in adult cancer patients. The guidelines were commissioned and financially supported by ESPEN and by the European Partnership for Action Against Cancer (EPAAC), an EU level initiative. Members of the guideline group were selected by ESPEN to include a range of professions and fields of expertise. We searched for meta-analyses, systematic reviews and comparative studies based on clinical questions according to the PICO format. The evidence was evaluated and merged to develop clinical recommendations using the GRADE method. Due to the deficits in the available evidence, relevant still open questions were listed and should be addressed by future studies. Malnutrition and a loss of muscle mass are frequent in cancer patients and have a negative effect on clinical outcome. They may be driven by inadequate food intake, decreased physical activity and catabolic metabolic derangements. To screen for, prevent, assess in detail, monitor and treat malnutrition standard operating procedures, responsibilities and a quality control process should be established at each institution involved in treating cancer patients. All cancer patients should be screened regularly for the risk or the presence of malnutrition. In all patients - with the exception of end of life care - energy and substrate requirements should be met by offering in a step-wise manner nutritional interventions from counseling to parenteral nutrition. However, benefits and risks of nutritional interventions have to be balanced with special consideration in patients with advanced disease. Nutritional care should always be accompanied by exercise training. To counter malnutrition in patients with advanced cancer there are few pharmacological agents and pharmaconutrients with only limited effects. Cancer survivors should engage in regular physical activity and adopt a prudent diet.},

As there are no such data in patients with oesophagogastric cancer (OGC), this study investigated changes in body composition in OGC patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). METHODS: OGC patients who had CT scans before and after NAC were studied. CT images at the L3 vertebral level were analysed using SliceOmatic(\textregistered ) software to derive estimates of FFM and fat mass (FM). Comparisons were made between pre- and post-NAC CT images. Data are reported as mean~{$\pm~$}SD. RESULTS: Forty-seven patients (34 male) aged 63~{$\pm~$}12 years were studied and 79\% completed their course of NAC. The interval between CT scans was 107~{$\pm~$}27 days. The proportion of patients with sarcopenia increased from 57\% pre-NAC to 79\% post-NAC (p~=~0.046). During NAC there were significant reductions in estimated FFM and FM (2.9~{$\pm~$}4.7~kg, p~{$<~$}0.0001 and 1.3~{$\pm~$}3.2~kg, p~=~0.007, respectively). No association was demonstrated between loss of FFM and non-completion of NAC, increased hospital stay or mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with OGC commencing NAC, sarcopenia was present in 57\%. NAC was associated with further reductions in FFM and an increase in the proportion of patients becoming sarcopenic.},

  abstract = {The continuing advances in computed tomographic (CT) technology in the past decades have provided ongoing opportunities to improve CT image quality and clinical practice and discover new clinical CT imaging applications. New CT technology, however, has introduced new challenges in clinical radiology practice. One of the challenges is with intravenous contrast medium administration and scan timing. In this article, contrast medium pharmacokinetics and patient, contrast medium, and CT scanning factors associated with contrast enhancement and scan timing are presented and discussed. Published data from clinical studies of contrast medium and physiology are reviewed and interpreted. Computer simulation data are analyzed to provide an in-depth analysis of various factors associated with contrast enhancement and scan timing. On the basis of basic principles and analysis of the factors, clinical considerations and modifications to protocol design that are necessary to optimize contrast enhancement for common clinical CT applications are proposed.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Systemic relapses remain a major problem in locally advanced rectal cancer. Using short-course radiotherapy followed by chemotherapy and delayed surgery, the Rectal cancer And Preoperative Induction therapy followed by Dedicated Operation (RAPIDO) trial aimed to reduce distant metastases without compromising locoregional control. METHODS: In this multicentre, open-label, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial, participants were recruited from 54 centres in the Netherlands, Sweden, Spain, Slovenia, Denmark, Norway, and the USA. Patients were eligible if they were aged 18 years or older, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1, had a biopsy-proven, newly diagnosed, primary, locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma, which was classified as high risk on pelvic MRI (with at least one of the following criteria: clinical tumour [cT] stage cT4a or cT4b, extramural vascular invasion, clinical nodal [cN] stage cN2, involved mesorectal fascia, or enlarged lateral lymph nodes), were mentally and physically fit for chemotherapy, and could be assessed for staging within 5 weeks before randomisation. Eligible participants were randomly assigned (1:1), using a management system with a randomly varying block design (each block size randomly chosen to contain two to four allocations), stratified by centre, ECOG performance status, cT stage, and cN stage, to either the experimental or standard of care group. All investigators remained masked for the primary endpoint until a prespecified number of events was reached. Patients allocated to the experimental treatment group received short-course radiotherapy (5\hphantom{,}\texttimes\hphantom{,}5 Gy over a maximum of 8 days) followed by six cycles of CAPOX chemotherapy (capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 orally twice daily on days 1-14, oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1, and a chemotherapy-free interval between days 15-21) or nine cycles of FOLFOX4 (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1, leucovorin [folinic acid] 200 mg/m2 intravenously on days 1 and 2, followed by bolus fluorouracil 400 mg/m2 intravenously and fluorouracil 600 mg/m2 intravenously for 22 h on days 1 and 2, and a chemotherapy-free interval between days 3-14) followed by total mesorectal excision. Choice of CAPOX or FOLFOX4 was per physician discretion or hospital policy. Patients allocated to the standard of care group received 28 daily fractions of 1{$\cdot$}8 Gy up to 50{$\cdot$}4 Gy or 25 fractions of 2{$\cdot$}0 Gy up to 50{$\cdot$}0 Gy (per physician discretion or hospital policy), with concomitant twice-daily oral capecitabine 825 mg/m2 followed by total mesorectal excision and, if stipulated by hospital policy, adjuvant chemotherapy with eight cycles of CAPOX or 12 cycles of FOLFOX4. The primary endpoint was 3-year disease-related treatment failure, defined as the first occurrence of locoregional failure, distant metastasis, new primary colorectal tumour, or treatment-related death, assessed in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed by intention to treat. This study is registered with the EudraCT, 2010-023957-12, and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01558921, and is now complete. FINDINGS: Between June 21, 2011, and June 2, 2016, 920 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to a treatment, of whom 912 were eligible (462 in the experimental group; 450 in the standard of care group). Median follow-up was 4{$\cdot$}6 years (IQR 3{$\cdot$}5-5{$\cdot$}5). At 3 years after randomisation, the cumulative probability of disease-related treatment failure was 23{$\cdot$}7\% (95\% CI 19{$\cdot$}8-27{$\cdot$}6) in the experimental group versus 30{$\cdot$}4\% (26{$\cdot$}1-34{$\cdot$}6) in the standard of care group (hazard ratio 0{$\cdot$}75, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}60-0{$\cdot$}95; p=0{$\cdot$}019). The most common grade 3 or higher adverse event during preoperative therapy in both groups was diarrhoea (81 [18\%] of 460 patients in the experimental group and 41 [9\%] of 441 in the standard of care group) and neurological toxicity during adjuvant chemotherapy in the standard of care group (16 [9\%] of 187 patients). Serious adverse events occurred in 177 (38\%) of 460 participants in the experimental group and, in the standard of care group, in 87 (34\%) of 254 patients without adjuvant chemotherapy and in 64 (34\%) of 187 with adjuvant chemotherapy. Treatment-related deaths occurred in four participants in the experimental group (one cardiac arrest, one pulmonary embolism, two infectious complications) and in four participants in the standard of care group (one pulmonary embolism, one neutropenic sepsis, one aspiration, one suicide due to severe depression). INTERPRETATION: The observed decreased probability of disease-related treatment failure in the experimental group is probably indicative of the increased efficacy of preoperative chemotherapy as opposed to adjuvant chemotherapy in this setting. Therefore, the experimental treatment can be considered as a new standard of care in high-risk locally advanced rectal cancer.

  abstract = {Though once considered the gold standard, epidural anaesthesia has complications that may be significant and include hypotension, urinary retention, partial or patchy block and, in rare cases, devastating neurological injuries also. Paravertebral block (PVB) is an alternative technique for unilateral surgical procedures like thoracotomy, which may offer similar analgesic effectiveness and a more favourable side-effect profile than epidural analgesia. This systematic review and meta-analysis of published randomized clinical trials aims to compare thoracic paravertebral with thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) in thoracotomy for lung surgery. Five hundred and forty-one patients from 12 clinical trials have been included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. We found that visual analogue scale (VAS) scores at rest and during activity/coughing at 4-8, 24 and 48 h postoperatively were similar in both the PVB and TEA groups. Considering studies not included in the previous meta-analysis, a VAS score on activity at 48 h is significantly better in the PVB group (mean difference 0.40 cm; 95\% confidence interval [95\% CI] 0.77, 0.02; Mantel-Haenszel (M-H) fixed). Hypotension (odds ratio 0.13; 95\% CI 0.06, 0.31; M-H fixed) and urinary retention are more common in the epidural analgesia group. So, we conclude that thoracic PVB may be as effective as thoracic epidural analgesia for post-thoracotomy pain relief and is also associated with fewer complications.},

Older adults have been underrepresented in cancer clinical trials, leading to paucity of guidelines to meet the treatment challenges in this population. To evaluate an older adult with cancer, oncologists must understand age-related changes and identify the subset of population who is vulnerable and at risk of cancer treatment toxicity. Comprehensive geriatric assessments focusing on functional status, multimorbidity, nutritional status, cognitive impairment, and psychosocial support help recognize heterogeneity among older adults, leading to individualized approaches toward cancer treatment.

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To explore the effectiveness of trilaciclib and ALRN-6924 in the prevention of cancer chemotherapy-induced toxicity in older patients. New chemoprotective agents are necessary because age is the main risk factor for chemotherapy complications that account largely for the poorer outcome of cancer in the elderly. Trilaciclib and ALRN-6924 cause a reversible block of the proliferation of normal cells through cell cycle arrest (CCA). With this mechanism, they may prevent the toxicity of cycle-active cancer treatment including neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, mucositis, and alopecia. RECENT FINDINGS: Myelopoietic growth factors may prevent neutropenia in the aged, but they may cause severe bone pain, may aggravate thrombocytopenia and anemia, and may cause myelodysplasia and acute leukemia as a late complication. The prevention of thrombocytopenia, anemia, mucositis, and alopecia is unsatisfactory at present. These complications may jeopardize the treatment outcome as they require a reduction of treatment dose/intensity and because many patients find the resulting symptoms intolerable. In three studies of patients with extensive disease small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC), trilaciclib reduced the severity and duration of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia as well as the need for blood transfusions. In addition, it produced a significant expansion of T-cell clones. Trilaciclib received FDA approval for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression in patients with ES-SCLC. ALRN-6924 is currently studied in phase II study of ES-SCLC. In a phase IB of 38 patients, ALRN-6924 prevented myelosuppression to an extent comparable with trilaciclib. Both drugs proved as effective in patients 65 and older as they were in the younger ones. In an "ex vivo" study, ALRN-6924 protected the epithelial stem cells of hair follicles from taxanes and promised to prevent alopecia. The possibility that CCA of tumor cells may reduce the effectiveness of cycle-active chemotherapy is a major concern. For this reason, the use of trilaciclib, an inhibitor of CDK 4/6, should be limited to tumors with inactivated RB1, and the use of ALRN-6924, an inhibitor of P53, should be limited to tumors with inactivated P53. Chemotherapy-related toxicities limit dose intensity and contribute to significant morbidity and mortality in elderly cancer patients. Trilaciclib and ALRN-6924 are of particular interest to geriatric oncologists because of their novel mechanism of action. Ameliorating chemotherapy-induced toxicities holds the promise of transforming the practice of geriatric oncology by enabling chemotherapeutic regimens that are currently not feasible for this patient population. Specifically, these agents may prevent chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, perhaps the most life-threatening complications of cytotoxic chemotherapy, thereby obviating the need for the use of rescue strategies such as hematopoietic growth factors. In addition, these agents offer the potential for broad tissue protection from other chemotherapy-related toxicities, including mucositis, diarrhea, and alopecia, which historically have been poorly managed. Importantly, by preventing a spectrum of chemotherapy-related toxicities, these agents may permit the administration of chemotherapy at full-dose intensity, prevent functional decline, and grant maintenance of resilience to older cancer patients. As a result, the successful prevention of chemotherapy-induced side effects may not only mitigate the costs of care but also improve patient outcomes and quality of life. Finally, chemoprotective strategies offer the opportunity to apply geriatric principles to clinical trials of cancer treatment. In particular, they may allow the testing of prolongation of "active life expectancy" as a major goal of clinical trials in elderly patients. They may also enable novel and more practical forms of clinical trials. By assessing the risk of chemotherapy-related toxicity with the Chemotherapy Risk Assessment Scale for High Age Patients (CRASH) or the Cancer and Aging Research Group (CARG) instruments, these agents may permit researchers to utilize patients as their own controls and endorse the approval of supportive care drugs based upon the risk profile of individual patients.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: D2 gastrectomy is recommended in US and European guidelines, and is preferred in east Asia, for patients with resectable gastric cancer. Adjuvant chemotherapy improves patient outcomes after surgery, but the benefits after a D2 resection have not been extensively investigated in large-scale trials. We investigated the effect on disease-free survival of adjuvant chemotherapy with capecitabine plus oxaliplatin after D2 gastrectomy compared with D2 gastrectomy only in patients with stage II-IIIB gastric cancer. METHODS: The capecitabine and oxaliplatin adjuvant study in stomach cancer (CLASSIC) study was an open-label, parallel-group, phase 3, randomised controlled trial undertaken in 37 centres in South Korea, China, and Taiwan. Patients with stage II-IIIB gastric cancer who had had curative D2 gastrectomy were randomly assigned to receive adjuvant chemotherapy of eight 3-week cycles of oral capecitabine (1000 mg/m(2) twice daily on days 1 to 14 of each cycle) plus intravenous oxaliplatin (130 mg/m(2) on day 1 of each cycle) for 6 months or surgery only. Block randomisation was done by a central interactive computerised system, stratified by country and disease stage. Patients, and investigators giving interventions, assessing outcomes, and analysing data were not masked. The primary endpoint was 3 year disease-free survival, analysed by intention to treat. This study reports a prespecified interim efficacy analysis, after which the trial was stopped after a recommendation by the data monitoring committee. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00411229). FINDINGS: 1035 patients were randomised (520 to receive chemotherapy and surgery, 515 surgery only). Median follow-up was 34{$\cdot$}2 months (25{$\cdot$}4-41{$\cdot$}7) in the chemotherapy and surgery group and 34{$\cdot$}3 months (25{$\cdot$}6-41{$\cdot$}9) in the surgery only group. 3 year disease-free survival was 74\% (95\% CI 69-79) in the chemotherapy and surgery group and 59\% (53-64) in the surgery only group (hazard ratio 0{$\cdot$}56, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}44-0{$\cdot$}72; p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were reported in 279 of 496 patients (56\%) in the chemotherapy and surgery group and in 30 of 478 patients (6\%) in the surgery only group. The most common adverse events in the intervention group were nausea (n=326), neutropenia (n=300), and decreased appetite (n=294). INTERPRETATION: Adjuvant capecitabine plus oxaliplatin treatment after curative D2 gastrectomy should be considered as a treatment option for patients with operable gastric cancer.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The prominent clinical feature of cachexia has traditionally been understood to be weight loss; however, in recognition of the potential for divergent behavior of muscle and adipose tissue, cachexia was recently defined as loss of muscle with or without loss of fat mass. Detailed assessments are required to verify body composition in patients with cancer cachexia. DESIGN: We adopted a population-based approach to study body composition in patients with cancer, with the use of diagnostic computed tomography images acquired for cancer diagnosis and follow-up. A prospective cohort of 441 patients with non-small cell lung cancer, who were referred consecutively to a regional medical oncology service in Alberta, Canada, was evaluated. RESULTS: At referral (median time to death: 265 d), mean body mass index (BMI; in kg/m(2)) was 24.9, with 47.4\% of patients being overweight or obese. Only 7.5\% overall were underweight as conventionally understood (BMI {$<$} 18.5). Analysis of computed tomography images showed extremely high heterogeneity of muscle mass within all strata of BMI. The overall prevalence of severe muscle depletion (sarcopenia) was 46.8\% and was present in patients in all BMI categories. A much higher proportion of men (61\%) than women (31\%) met the criteria for sarcopenia. CONCLUSIONS: Wasting of skeletal muscle is a prominent feature of patients with lung cancer, despite normal or heavy body weights. The significance of muscle wasting in normal-weight, overweight, and obese patients as a nutritional risk factor, as a prognostic factor, and as a predictor of cancer treatment toxicity is discussed in this article.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: An increasing number of older patients is undergoing curative, surgical treatment of esophageal cancer. Previous meta-analyses have shown that older patients suffered from more postoperative morbidity and mortality compared to younger patients, which may lead to patient selection based on age. However, only studies including patients that underwent open esophagectomy were included. Therefore, it remains unknown whether there is an association between age and outcome in patients undergoing minimally invasive esophagectomy. AIM: To perform a systematic review on age and postoperative outcome in esophageal cancer patients undergoing esophagectomy. METHODS: Studies comparing older with younger patients with primary esophageal cancer undergoing curative esophagectomy were included. Meta-analysis of studies using a 75-year age threshold are presented in the manuscript, studies using other age thresholds in the Supplementary material. MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Library were searched for articles published between 1995 and 2020. Risk of bias was assessed with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Primary outcomes were anastomotic leak, pulmonary and cardiac complications, delirium, 30- and 90-d, and in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included pneumonia and 5-year overall survival. RESULTS: Seven studies (4847 patients) using an age threshold of 75 years were included for meta-analysis with 755 older and 4092 younger patients. Older patients (9.05\%) had higher rates of 90-d mortality compared with younger patients (3.92\%), (confidence interval = 1.10-5.56). In addition, older patients (9.45\%) had higher rates of in-hospital mortality compared with younger patients (3.68\%), (confidence interval = 1.01-5.91). In the subgroup of 2 studies with minimally invasive esophagectomy, older and younger patients had comparable 30-d, 90-d and in-hospital mortality rates. CONCLUSION: Older patients undergoing curative esophagectomy for esophageal cancer have a higher postoperative mortality risk. Minimally invasive esophagectomy may be important for minimizing mortality in older patients.},

Low-dose, noncontrast CT examinations were obtained at 33 clinical sites, using scanners from four manufacturers. The study participants had a mean age of 71.6 years (range, 70-74 years). Ground truth was obtained by manually segmenting the left paraspinous muscle at the level of the T12 vertebra. Muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) and muscle attenuation (MA) were recorded. Comparison between the ML algorithm and ground truth measures of muscle CSA and MA were obtained using Dice similarity coefficients and Pearson correlations. RESULTS: Compared to ground truth segmentation, the ML algorithm achieved median (standard deviation) Dice scores of 0.94 (0.04) in the test set. Mean (SD) muscle CSA was 14.3 (3.6) cm2 for ground truth and 13.7 (3.5) cm2 for ML segmentation. Mean (SD) MA was 41.6 (7.6) Hounsfield units (HU) for ground truth and 43.5 (7.9) HU for ML segmentation. There was high correlation between ML algorithm and ground truth for muscle CSA (r2\,=\,0.86; p {$<$} 0.0001) and MA (r2\,=\,0.95; p {$<$} 0.0001). CONCLUSION: The ML algorithm for measurement of paraspinous muscles compared favorably to manual ground truth measurements in the NLST. The algorithm generalized well to a heterogeneous set of low-dose CT images and may be capable of automated quantification of muscle metrics to screen for sarcopenia on routine chest CT examinations.},

We evaluated the effect of sarcopenia on chemotherapy toxicity among metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients. All consecutive mCRC patients in 3 hospitals were enrolled in this prospective, cross-sectional, multicenter study. Several nutritional indexes and scores were generated. Computed tomography (CT) images were analyzed to evaluate cross-sectional areas of muscle tissue (MT), visceral adipose tissue (VAT), and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT). Toxicities were evaluated in the 2 mo following clinical evaluation. Fifty-one mCRC patients were included in the study. Sarcopenia was observed in 71\% of patients (39\% of women and 82\% of men) whereas only 4\% and 18\% were considered as underweight using body mass index (BMI) or severely malnourished using the Nutritional Risk Index (NRI), respectively. Grade 3-4 toxicities were observed in 28\% of patients. In multivariate analysis including age, sex, BMI, sarcopenia, SAT, and VAT, the only factor associated with Grade 3-4 toxicities was sarcopenia (odds ratio = 13.55; 95\% confidence interval [1.08; 169.31], P = 0.043). In mCRC patients undergoing chemotherapy, sarcopenia was much more frequently observed than visible malnutrition. Despite the small number of patients included in our study, we found sarcopenia to be significantly associated with severe chemotherapy toxicity.},

This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of darbepoetin alpha given with IV iron versus with local standard practice (oral iron or no iron). PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this multicenter, randomized, open-label, phase III study, 396 patients with nonmyeloid malignancies and hemoglobin (Hb) less than 11 g/dL received darbepoetin alpha 500 microg with (n = 200) or without (n = 196) IV iron once every 3 weeks (Q3W) for 16 weeks. RESULTS: The hematopoietic response rate (proportion of patients achieving Hb {$>$}or= 12 g/dL or Hb increase of {$>$}or= 2 g/dL from baseline) was significantly higher in the IV iron group: 86\% versus 73\% in the standard practice group (difference of 13\% [95\% CI, 3\% to 23\%]; P = .011). Fewer RBC transfusions (week 5 to the end of the treatment period) occurred in the IV iron group: 9\% versus 20\% in the standard practice group (difference of -11\% [95\% CI, -18\% to -3\%]; P = .005). Both treatments were well tolerated with no notable differences in adverse events. Serious adverse events related to iron occurred in 3\% of patients in the IV iron group and were mostly gastrointestinal in nature. CONCLUSION: Addition of IV iron to darbepoetin alpha Q3W in patients with chemotherapy-induced anemia was well tolerated, resulting in an improved hematopoietic response rate and lower incidence of transfusions compared with darbepoetin alpha alone.},

  abstract = {Esophagogastric cancer is among the most common malignancies worldwide. Surgery with or without neoadjuvant therapy is the only potentially curative treatment option. Although esophagogastric resections remain associated with major surgical trauma and significant postoperative morbidity. Prehabilitation has emerged as a novel strategy to improve clinical outcomes by optimizing physical and psychological status before major surgery through exercise and nutritional and psychological interventions. Current prehabilitation programs may be unimodal, including only one intervention, or multimodal, combining the benefits of different types of interventions. However, it still is an investigational treatment option mostly limited to clinical trials. In this comprehensive review, we summarize the current evidence for the role of prehabilitation in modern esophagogastric cancer surgery. The available studies are very heterogeneous in design, type of interventions, and measured outcomes. Yet, all of them confirm at least some positive effects of prehabilitation in terms of improved physical performance, nutritional status, quality of life, or even reduced postoperative morbidity. However, the optimal interventions for prehabilitation remain unclear; thus, they cannot be standardized and widely adopted. Future studies on multimodal prehabilitation are necessary to develop optimal programs for patients with esophagogastric cancer.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to estimate the incidence and cumulative risk of major surgery in older persons over a 5-year period and evaluate how these estimates differ according to key demographic and geriatric characteristics. BACKGROUND: As the population of the United States ages, there is considerable interest in ensuring safe, high-quality surgical care for older persons. Yet, valid, generalizable data on the occurrence of major surgery in the geriatric population are sparse. METHODS: We evaluated data from a prospective longitudinal study of 5,571 community-living fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries, aged 65 or older, from the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS) from 2011 to 2016. Major surgeries were identified through linkages with Centers for Medicare \& Medicaid Services data. Population-based incidence and cumulative risk estimates incorporated NHATS analytic sampling weights and cluster and strata variables. RESULTS: The nationally-representative incidence of major surgery per 100 person-years was 8.8, with estimates of 5.2 and 3.7 for elective and non-elective surgeries. The adjusted incidence of major surgery peaked at 10.8 in persons 75-79{$\mkern1mu$}years, increased from 6.6 in the non-frail group to 10.3 in the frail group, and was similar by sex and dementia. The 5-year cumulative risk of major surgery was 13.8\%, representing nearly 5 million unique older persons, including 12.1\% in persons 85-89{$\mkern1mu$}years, 9.1\% in those {$\geq$}90{$\mkern1mu$}years, 12.1\% in those with frailty, and 12.4\% in those with probable dementia. CONCLUSIONS: Major surgery is a common event in the lives of community-living older persons, including high-risk vulnerable subgroups.},

Therefore, a randomized trial was carried out to compare, in responders only, chemoradiation alone with chemoradiation followed by surgery in patients with locally advanced tumors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients had operable T3N0-1M0 thoracic esophageal cancer. Patients received two cycles of fluorouracil (FU) and cisplatin (days 1 to 5 and 22 to 26) and either conventional (46 Gy in 4.5 weeks) or split-course (15 Gy, days 1 to 5 and 22 to 26) concomitant radiotherapy. Patients with response and no contraindication to either treatment were randomly assigned to surgery (arm A) or continuation of chemoradiation (arm B; three cycles of FU/cisplatin and either conventional [20 Gy] or split-course [15 Gy] radiotherapy). Chemoradiation was considered equivalent to surgery if the difference in 2-year survival rate was less than 10\%. RESULTS: Of 444 eligible patients, 259 were randomly assigned; 230 patients (88.8\%) had epidermoid cancer, and 29 (11.2\%) had glandular carcinoma. Two-year survival rate was 34\% in arm A versus 40\% in arm B (hazard ratio for arm B v arm A = 0.90; adjusted P = .44). Median survival time was 17.7 months in arm A compared with 19.3 months in arm B. Two-year local control rate was 66.4\% in arm A compared with 57.0\% in arm B, and stents were less required in the surgery arm (5\% in arm A v 32\% in arm B; P {$<$} .001). The 3-month mortality rate was 9.3\% in arm A compared with 0.8\% in arm B (P = .002). Cumulative hospital stay was 68 days in arm A compared with 52 days in arm B (P = .02). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that, in patients with locally advanced thoracic esophageal cancers, especially epidermoid, who respond to chemoradiation, there is no benefit for the addition of surgery after chemoradiation compared with the continuation of additional chemoradiation.},

Our approach does not require any assumptions on which part of the patient's body is covered by the scan. It relies on an original machine learning regression approach. Our models are learned using the transfer learning trick by exploiting deep architectures that have been pre-trained on imageNet database, and therefore it requires very little annotation for its training. The whole pipeline consists of three steps: i) conversion of the CT scans into Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP) images, ii) prediction from a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) applied in a sliding window fashion over the MIP image, and iii) robust analysis of the prediction sequence to predict the height of the desired slice within the whole CT scan. Our approach is applied to the detection of the third lumbar vertebra (L3) slice that has been found to be representative to the whole body composition. Our system is evaluated on a database collected in our clinical center, containing 642 CT scans from different patients. We obtained an average localization error of 1.91{$\pm$}2.69 slices (less than 5~mm) in an average time of less than 2.5~s/CT scan, allowing integration of the proposed system into daily clinical routines.},

Different definitions of sarcopenia have been used, with quantitative data more frequently used in oncology, while functional measures have been advocated in the geriatric literature. Little is known about the correlation between frailty status as assessed by comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) and sarcopenia in cancer patients. We retrospectively analyzed data from 96 older women with early breast cancer who underwent CGAs and Dual X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) scans for muscle mass assessment before cancer treatment at a single cancer center from 2016 to 2019 to explore the correlation between frailty status as assessed by CGA and sarcopenia using different definitions. Based on the results of the CGA, 35 patients (36.5\%) were defined as frail. Using DXA Appendicular Skeletal Mass (ASM) or the Skeletal Muscle Index (SMI=ASM/height\^2), 41 patients were found to be sarcopenic (42.7\%), with no significant difference in prevalence between frail and nonfrail subjects. Using the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP2) definition of sarcopenia (where both muscle function and mass are required), 58 patients were classified as "probably" sarcopenic; among these, 25 were sarcopenic and 17 "severely" sarcopenic. Only 13 patients satisfied both the requirements for being defined as sarcopenic and frail. Grade 3-4 treatment-related toxicities (according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) were more common in sarcopenic and frail sarcopenic patients. Our data support the use of a definition of sarcopenia that includes both quantitative and functional data in order to identify frail patients who need tailored treatment.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Barrett's oesophagus is one of the most common pre-malignant lesions in the world. Currently the mainstay of therapy is surgical management of advanced cancer but this has improved the five-year survival very little since the 1980s. As a consequence, improved survival relies on early detection through endoscopic surveillance programmes. Success of this strategy relies on the fact that late-stage pre-malignant lesions or very early cancers can be cured by intervention. Currently there is considerable controversy over which method is best: that is conventional open surgery or endotherapy (techniques involving endoscopy). OBJECTIVES: We used data from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to examine the effectiveness of endotherapies compared with surgery in people with Barrett's oesophagus, those with early neoplasias (defined as high-grade dysplasia (HGD) and those with early cancer (defined as carcinoma in-situ, superficially invasive, early cancer or superficial cancer T-1m (T1-a) and T-1sm (T1-b)). SEARCH METHODS: We used the Cochrane highly sensitive search strategy to identify RCTs in MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), ISI Web of Science, EBMR, Controlled Trials mRCT and ISRCTN, and LILACS, in July and August 2008. The searches were updated in 2009 and again in April 2012. SELECTION CRITERIA: Types of studies: RCTs comparing endotherapies with surgery in the treatment of high-grade dysplasia or early cancer. All cellular types of cancer were included (i.e. adenocarcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas and more unusual types) but will be discussed separately. TYPES OF PARTICIPANTS: patients of any age and either gender with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of early neoplasia (HGD and early cancer) in Barrett's or squamous lined oesophagus. Types of interventions; endotherapies (the intervention) compared with surgery (the control), all with curative intent. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Reports of studies that meet the inclusion criteria for this review would have been analysed using the methods detailed in Appendix 9. MAIN RESULTS: We did not identify any studies that met the inclusion criteria. In total we excluded 13 studies that were not RCTs but that compared surgery and endotherapies. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This Cochrane review has indicated that there are no RCTs to compare management options in this vital area, therefore trials should be undertaken as a matter of urgency. The problems with such randomised methods are standardising surgery and endotherapies in all sites, standardising histopathology in all centres, assessing which patients are fit or unfit for surgery and making sure there are relevant outcomes for the study (i.e. long-term survival (over five or more years)) and no progression of HGD.},

DESIGN: Single center, randomized, double-blind controlled trial. SETTING: Teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Adult cancer patients with septic shock in the first 6 hours of ICU admission. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to the liberal (hemoglobin threshold, {$<$} 9\,g/dL) or to the restrictive strategy (hemoglobin threshold, {$<$} 7\,g/dL) of RBC transfusion during ICU stay. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Patients were randomized to the liberal (n = 149) or to the restrictive transfusion strategy (n = 151) group. Patients in the liberal group received more RBC units than patients in the restrictive group (1 [0-3] vs 0 [0-2] unit; p {$<$} 0.001). At 28 days after randomization, mortality rate in the liberal group (primary endpoint of the study) was 45\% (67 patients) versus 56\% (84 patients) in the restrictive group (hazard ratio, 0.74; 95\% CI, 0.53-1.04; p = 0.08) with no differences in ICU and hospital length of stay. At 90 days after randomization, mortality rate in the liberal group was lower (59\% vs 70\%) than in the restrictive group (hazard ratio, 0.72; 95\% CI, 0.53-0.97; p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: We observed a survival trend favoring a liberal transfusion strategy in patients with septic shock when compared with the restrictive strategy. These results went in the opposite direction of the a priori hypothesis and of other trials in the field and need to be confirmed.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Esophageal endoscopic ultrasound is now regarded as essential in the staging of esophageal carcinoma. There is an increasing trend toward endoluminal therapies (ie, endoscopic mucosal resection and radiofrequency ablation) for pre-cancer or early-stage cancers because of concerns of high morbidity associated with esophagectomy. This study reviews our institutional experience with preoperative endoscopic ultrasound staging of early esophageal cancers in patients who underwent an esophagectomy to evaluate the accuracy of staging by endoscopic ultrasound and how this affects treatment recommendations. METHODS: A prospective esophagectomy database of all patients undergoing an esophagectomy for esophageal cancer at a single high-volume institution was retrospectively reviewed for patients with early-stage esophageal cancer. This study analyzed patients with clinical Tis to T1 disease, as predicted by preoperative endoscopic ultrasound, and correlated this with the pathologic stages after esophagectomy. The surgical outcomes were evaluated to assess the safety of esophagectomy as a treatment modality. RESULTS: From 2005 to 2011, 107 patients (93 male, 14 female) with a mean age of 66 years (range, 39-91 years) were staged by preoperative endoscopic ultrasound to have esophageal high-grade dysplasia, carcinoma in situ, or T1 cancer and underwent an esophagectomy. Tumor depth was correctly staged by endoscopic ultrasound in only 39\% (23/59) of pT1a tumors (invading into the lamina propria or muscularis mucosa) and 51\% (18/35) of pT1b tumors (submucosal). Of the endoscopic ultrasound-staged cT1a-lpN0 lesions, there were positive lymph nodes in 15\% of pathologic specimens (2/13). Patients with pT1a-mm lesions had a 9\% rate of pathologic lymph node involvement (1/11), and those with pT1b tumors had a 17\% rate of lymph node spread (6/35). Esophagectomy was performed in all 107 patients with a 30-day mortality rate of less than 1\% (1/107). CONCLUSIONS: The sensitivity and specificity of endoscopic ultrasound for determining true pathologic staging are poor for early-stage esophageal cancers. Lesions thought to be cT1a-lpN0 by endoscopic ultrasound have at least pN1 disease in 15\% of cases. Endoluminal therapy of these lesions based on endoscopic ultrasound undertreats a significant number of patients. Esophagectomy is still the standard therapy for early-stage esophageal cancers in the majority of patients.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Patients undergoing an esophagectomy are often kept nil-by-mouth postoperatively out of fear for increasing anastomotic leakage and pulmonary complications. This study investigates the effect of direct start of oral feeding following minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) compared with standard of care. BACKGROUND: Elements of enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols have been successfully introduced in patients undergoing an esophagectomy. However, start of oral intake, which is an essential part of the ERAS protocols, remains a matter of debate. METHODS: Patients in this multicenter, international randomized controlled trial were randomized to directly start oral feeding (intervention) after a MIE with intrathoracic anastomosis or to receive nil-by-mouth and tube feeding for 5 days postoperative (control group). Primary outcome was time to functional recovery. Secondary outcome parameters included anastomotic leakage, pneumonia rate, and other surgical complications scored by predefined definitions. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were similar in the intervention (n = 65) and control (n = 67) group. Functional recovery was 7 days for patients receiving direct oral feeding compared with 8 days in the control group (P = 0.436). Anastomotic leakage rate did not differ in the intervention (18.5\%) and control group (16.4\%, P = 0.757). Pneumonia rates were comparable between the intervention (24.6\%) and control group (34.3\%, P = 0.221). Other morbidity rates were similar, except for chyle leakage, which was more prevalent in the standard of care group (P = 0.032). CONCLUSION: Direct oral feeding after an esophagectomy does not affect functional recovery and did not increase incidence or severity of postoperative complications.},

However, in esophageal cancer patients the radiation dose to the heart is usually markedly higher. To determine whether radiation-induced cardiac toxicity is also a relevant issue for this group, we conducted a review of the current literature. METHODS: A literature search was performed in Medline for papers concerning cardiac toxicity in esophageal cancer patients treated with radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy. RESULTS: The overall crude incidence of symptomatic cardiac toxicity was as high as 10.8\%. Toxicities corresponded with several dose-volume parameters of the heart. The most frequently reported complications were pericardial effusion, ischemic heart disease and heart failure. CONCLUSION: Cardiac toxicity is a relevant issue in the treatment of esophageal cancer. However, valid Normal Tissue Complication Probability models for esophageal cancer are not available at present.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Surgical stress in the presence of fasting worsens the catabolic state, causes insulin resistance and may delay recovery. Carbohydrate rich drinks given preoperatively may ameliorate these deleterious effects. A systematic review was undertaken to analyse the effect of preoperative carbohydrate loading on insulin resistance, gastric emptying, gastric acidity, patient wellbeing, immunity and nutrition following surgery. METHODS: All studies identified through PubMed until September 2011 were included. References were cross-checked to ensure capture of cited pertinent articles. RESULTS: Overall, 17 randomised controlled trials with a total of 1,445 patients who met the inclusion criteria were identified. Preoperative carbohydrate drinks significantly improved insulin resistance and indices of patient comfort following surgery, especially hunger, thirst, malaise, anxiety and nausea. No definite conclusions could be made regarding preservation of muscle mass. Following ingestion of carbohydrate drinks, no adverse events such as apparent or proven aspiration during or after surgery were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of oral carbohydrate drinks before surgery is probably safe and may have a positive influence on a wide range of perioperative markers of clinical outcome. Further studies are required to determine its cost effectiveness.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although the relation between hospital volume and surgical mortality is well established, for most procedures, the relative importance of the experience of the operating surgeon is uncertain. METHODS: Using information from the national Medicare claims data base for 1998 through 1999, we examined mortality among all 474,108 patients who underwent one of eight cardiovascular procedures or cancer resections. Using nested regression models, we examined the relations between operative mortality and surgeon volume and hospital volume (each in terms of total procedures performed per year), with adjustment for characteristics of the patients and other characteristics of the providers. RESULTS: Surgeon volume was inversely related to operative mortality for all eight procedures (P=0.003 for lung resection, P{$<$}0.001 for all other procedures). The adjusted odds ratio for operative death (for patients with a low-volume surgeon vs. those with a high-volume surgeon) varied widely according to the procedure--from 1.24 for lung resection to 3.61 for pancreatic resection. Surgeon volume accounted for a large proportion of the apparent effect of the hospital volume, to an extent that varied according to the procedure: it accounted for 100 percent of the effect for aortic-valve replacement, 57 percent for elective repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm, 55 percent for pancreatic resection, 49 percent for coronary-artery bypass grafting, 46 percent for esophagectomy, 39 percent for cystectomy, and 24 percent for lung resection. For most procedures, the mortality rate was higher among patients of low-volume surgeons than among those of high-volume surgeons, regardless of the surgical volume of the hospital in which they practiced. CONCLUSIONS: For many procedures, the observed associations between hospital volume and operative mortality are largely mediated by surgeon volume. Patients can often improve their chances of survival substantially, even at high-volume hospitals, by selecting surgeons who perform the operations frequently.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Low muscle mass is present in approximately 40\% of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) and may be associated with poor outcome. We studied change in skeletal muscle during palliative chemotherapy in patients with mCRC and its association with treatment modifications and overall survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 67 patients with mCRC (mean age {$\pm$} standard deviation, 66.4 {$\pm$} 10.6 years; 63\% male), muscle area (square centimeters) was assessed using computed tomography scans of the third lumbar vertebra before and during palliative chemotherapy. Treatment modifications resulting from toxicity were evaluated, including delay, dose reduction, or termination of chemotherapy. Multiple regression analyses were performed for the association between change in muscle area and treatment modification and secondly overall survival. RESULTS: Muscle area of patients with mCRC decreased significantly during 3 months of chemotherapy by 6.1\% (95\% CI, -8.4 to -3.8; P {$<$} .001). Change in muscle area was not associated with treatment modifications. However, patients with muscle loss during treatment of 9\% or more (lowest tertile) had significantly lower survival rates than patients with muscle loss of less than 9\% (at 6 months, 33\% v 69\% of patients alive; at 1 year, 17\% v 49\% of patients alive; log-rank P = .001). Muscle loss of 9\% or more remained independently associated with survival when adjusted for sex, age, baseline lactate dehydrogenase concentration, comorbidity, mono-organ or multiorgan metastases, treatment line, and tumor progression at first evaluation by computed tomography scan (hazard ratio, 4.47; 95\% CI, 2.21 to 9.05; P {$<$} .001). CONCLUSION: Muscle area decreased significantly during chemotherapy and was independently associated with survival in patients with mCRC. Further clinical evaluation is required to determine whether nutritional interventions and exercise training may preserve muscle area and thereby improve outcome.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Weight loss limits cancer therapy, quality of life and survival. Common diagnostic criteria and a framework for a classification system for cancer cachexia were recently agreed upon by international consensus. Specific assessment domains (stores, intake, catabolism and function) were proposed. The aim of this study is to validate this diagnostic criteria (two groups: model 1) and examine a four-group (model 2) classification system regarding these domains as well as survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from an international patient sample with advanced cancer (N = 1070) were analysed. In model 1, the diagnostic criteria for cancer cachexia [weight loss/body mass index (BMI)] were used. Model 2 classified patients into four groups 0-III, according to weight loss/BMI as a framework for cachexia stages. The cachexia domains, survival and sociodemographic/medical variables were compared across models. RESULTS: Eight hundred and sixty-one patients were included. Model 1 consisted of 399 cachectic and 462 non-cachectic patients. Cachectic patients had significantly higher levels of inflammation, lower nutritional intake and performance status and shorter survival. In model 2, differences were not consistent; appetite loss did not differ between group III and IV, and performance status not between group 0 and I. Survival was shorter in group II and III compared with other groups. By adding other cachexia domains to the model, survival differences were demonstrated. CONCLUSION: The diagnostic criteria based on weight loss and BMI distinguish between cachectic and non-cachectic patients concerning all domains (intake, catabolism and function) and is associated with survival. In order to guide cachexia treatment a four-group classification model needs additional domains to discriminate between cachexia stages.},

In severely anaemic patients, an Hb increase of 0.6 (0.4; 1.2) and 1.2 (0.7; 1.6) g/dl was detected with iron supplementation 6-10 and {$>$}\,10 days before surgery, respectively. Hb increased by 0 (-0.1; 0) g/dl with iron supplementation 1-5 days before surgery, 0.2 (-0.1; 0.5) g/dl with iron supplementation 6-10 days before surgery, and 0.2 (-0.2; 1.1) g/dl with supplementation\,{$>$}\,10 days before surgery (p\,{$<$}\,0.001 for 1-5 vs. 6-10 days). Overall, 58\% of A+,ID+,T+ patients showed an Hb increase of {$>$}\,0.5~g/dl. The number of transfused red blood cell units was significantly lower in patients supplemented with iron (0 (0; 3)) compared to non-treated anaemic patients (1 (0; 4)) (p\,=\,0.03). Patients with iron supplementation\,{$>$}\,6 days before surgery achieved mobility 2 days earlier than patients with iron supplementation\,{$<$}\,6 days. CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous iron supplementation increases Hb level and thereby reduces blood transfusion rate in elderly surgical patients with ID anaemia.},

Here we report a 20-year follow-up of this investigation. METHODS: In 1973 we began a trial involving 386 women who were randomly assigned to receive either no further treatment after radical mastectomy (179 women) or 12 monthly cycles of adjuvant combination chemotherapy (207 women). All patients were admitted to the Istituto Nazionale Tumori in Milan, Italy. Adjuvant chemotherapy was delivered in the outpatient clinic of the Division of Medical Oncology. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 19.4 years, the patients given adjuvant combination chemotherapy had significantly better rates of relapse-free survival (unadjusted relative risk of relapse, 0.71; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.56 to 0.90; P = 0.004; adjusted relative risk, 0.65, 95 percent confidence interval, 0.51 to 0.83; P {$<$} 0.001) and total survival (unadjusted relative risk of death, 0.78; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.62 to 0.99; P = 0.04; adjusted relative risk, 0.76; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.60 to 0.97; P = 0.03). With the exception of postmenopausal women, a benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy was evident in all subgroups of patients. CONCLUSIONS: The long-term results of this trial of adjuvant combination chemotherapy confirm our preliminary observations of the effectiveness of the treatment in women with node-positive breast cancer.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Unlike for extremity sarcomas, the efficacy of radiotherapy for retroperitoneal sarcoma is not established. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of preoperative radiotherapy plus surgery versus surgery alone on abdominal recurrence-free survival. METHODS: EORTC-62092 is an open-label, randomised, phase 3 study done in 31 research institutions, hospitals, and cancer centres in 13 countries in Europe and North America. Adults (aged {$\geq$}18 years) with histologically documented, localised, primary retroperitoneal sarcoma that was operable and suitable for radiotherapy, who had not been previously treated and had a WHO performance status and American Society of Anesthesiologists score of 2 or lower, were centrally randomly assigned (1:1), using an interactive web response system and a minimisation algorithm, to receive either surgery alone or preoperative radiotherapy followed by surgery. Randomisation was stratified by hospital and performance status. Radiotherapy was delivered as 50{$\cdot$}4 Gy (in 28 daily fractions of 1{$\cdot$}8 Gy) in either 3D conformal radiotherapy or intensity modulated radiotherapy, and the objective of surgery was a macroscopically complete resection of the tumour mass with en-bloc organ resection as necessary. The primary endpoint was abdominal recurrence-free survival, as assessed by the investigator, and was analysed in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was analysed in all patients who started their allocated treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01344018. FINDINGS: Between Jan 18, 2012 and April 10, 2017, 266 patients were enrolled, of whom 133 were randomly assigned to each group. The median follow-up was 43{$\cdot$}1 months (IQR 28{$\cdot$}8-59{$\cdot$}2). 128 (96\%) patients from the surgery alone group had surgery, and 119 (89\%) patients in the radiotherapy and surgery group had both radiotherapy and surgery. Median abdominal recurrence-free survival was 4{$\cdot$}5 years (95\% CI 3{$\cdot$}9 to not estimable) in the radiotherapy plus surgery group and 5{$\cdot$}0 years (3{$\cdot$}4 to not estimable) in the surgery only group (hazard ratio 1{$\cdot$}01, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}71-1{$\cdot$}44; log rank p=0{$\cdot$}95). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were lymphopenia (98 [77\%] of 127 patients in the radiotherapy plus surgery group vs one [1\%] of 128 patients in the surgery alone group), anaemia (15 [12\%] vs ten [8\%]), and hypoalbuminaemia (15 [12\%] vs five [4\%]). Serious adverse events were reported in 30 (24\%) of 127 patients in the radiotherapy plus surgery group, and in 13 (10\%) of 128 patients in the surgery alone group. One (1\%) of 127 patients in the radiotherapy plus surgery group died due to treatment-related serious adverse events (gastropleural fistula), and no patients in the surgery alone group died due to treatment-related serious adverse events. INTERPRETATION: Preoperative radiotherapy should not be considered as standard of care treatment for retroperitoneal sarcoma.

To better understand how COVID-19 changed the pathway to diagnosis of cancer, we examined the length of intervals from symptom onset to diagnosis for 13 common cancer types with known clinical stage over 1-year nonpandemic period (March 2019 to March 2020; N~=~844) and three biannual COVID periods (March 2020 to September 2021; N~=~1172). We analyzed the patient interval (from first symptoms to presentation to a physician), the primary care/emergency department interval (from presentation with relevant symptoms to a primary care or emergency department physician to referral to a hospital-based diagnosis center) and the hospital interval (from referral to diagnosis). Compared to nonpandemic data, there were significant changes across COVID periods. The pandemic mostly impacted patient intervals for cancers diagnosed over the first 6 months after onset in March 2020. Overall median patient intervals were longest in the early COVID period (39 [IQR 22-64] days) and shortest in the nonpandemic period (20 [IQR 13-30] days; Kruskal-Wallis test [{$\chi$}2 ], P\,{$<$}\,.0001). Differences in clinical stage between periods were relevant, with cancers from the mid-period (September 2020 to March 2021) showing the most advanced stage. A shift to later stage was plausibly a result of delayed intervals in the early COVID period. Since intervals are eventually relevant to prognosis, our results provide a baseline against which the impact of improvement strategies to minimize the negative outcomes of COVID-19-associated cancer delays can be assessed and implemented.},

  abstract = {There has recently been increased interest in the assessment of body composition in patients with esophageal cancer for the purpose of nutritional evaluation and prognostication. This systematic review and meta-analysis intends to summarize and critically evaluate the current literature concerning the assessment of body composition in patients with esophageal cancer and to assess its potential implication upon early and late outcomes. A systematic literature search (up to August, 2017) was conducted for studies describing the assessment of body composition in patients with esophageal and gastroesophageal junctional cancer. Meta-analysis of postoperative outcomes including long-term survival was performed using random effects models. Twenty-nine studies reported the assessment of body composition in 3193 patients. Methods used to assess body composition in patients with esophageal cancer included computerized tomography (n~=~18 studies), bioelectrical impedance analysis (n~=~10), and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (n~=~1). Significant variability was observed in regard to study design and the criteria used to define individual parameters of body composition. Sarcopenic patients had a higher incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications (7 studies, OR 2.03, 95\% CI 1.32-3.11, P~=~0.001) after esophagectomy. Meta-analysis of six studies presenting long-term outcomes after esophagectomy identified significantly worse survival in patients who were sarcopenic (HR 1.70, 95\% CI 1.33- 2.17, P~{$<~$}0.0001). The assessment of body composition has the potential to become a clinically useful tool that could support decision-making in patients with esophageal cancer. Current evidence is however weakened by inconsistencies in methods of assessing and reporting body composition in this patient group.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two musculoskeletal radiologists reviewed standardized four-phase abdominal CT scans obtained with IV contrast material. The psoas area was measured, and the mean attenuation (in Hounsfield units) was recorded for the aorta, psoas muscles, posterior paraspinal muscles, and L4 vertebral body. CT attenuation measures were compared between anatomic regions and imaging phases with the paired t test; associations between measures were examined with the Pearson correlation coefficient (R). RESULTS: The study included 201 patients (97 men, 104 women; mean age, 57.7 {$\pm$} 12.5 [SD] years). Subject age was inversely correlated with unenhanced attenuation in the psoas muscles, posterior paraspinal muscles, and L4 (p {$<$} 0.001). The psoas muscles, posterior paraspinal muscles, and L4 enhanced significantly (p {$<$} 0.001) at all three contrast-enhanced phases. The greatest muscle enhancement was observed on delayed phase scans, whereas the greatest enhancement in L4 was seen on portal phase imaging. The unenhanced attenuation of the psoas muscles was significantly and negatively correlated with enhancement of the psoas muscles at the portal and delayed phases (p {$<$} 0.05 and p {$<$} 0.01, respectively), but these correlations were not seen for the posterior paraspinal muscles. Age was positively correlated with posterior paraspinal muscle enhancement at the portal and delayed phases in men (p {$<$} 0.05 and p {$<$} 0.01, respectively) but not in women. CONCLUSION: Contrast enhancement of commonly measured muscle and bone regions is routinely observed and should be considered when using CT attenuation values as biomarkers of sarcopenia and osteoporosis. Furthermore, CT enhancement may be significantly influenced by age, sex, and unenhanced tissue attenuation.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine the association between muscle cross-sectional area and attenuation, as measured on routine CT scans, and mortality in older patients with hip fracture. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective 10-year study of patients with hip fracture was conducted with the following inclusion criteria: age 65 years or older, first-time hip fracture treated with surgery, and CT of the chest, abdomen, or pelvis. This yielded 274 patients (70.4\% women; mean [{$\pm$} SD] age, 81.3 {$\pm$} 8.3 years). On each CT scan, two readers independently measured the size (cross-sectional area, indexed for patient height) and attenuation of the paravertebral muscle at T12 and the psoas muscle at L4. We then determined the association between overall mortality and the muscle size and muscle attenuation, while adjusting for demographic variables (age, sex, ethnicity, and body mass index), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification, and Charlson comorbidity index (CCI). RESULTS: The overall mortality rate increased from 28.3\% at 1 year to 79.5\% at 5 years. Mortality was associated with decreased thoracic muscle size (odds ratio [OR], 0.66; 95\% CI, 0.49-0.87). This association persisted after adjusting for demographic variables (OR, 0.69; 95\% CI, 0.50-0.95), the ASA classification (OR, 0.70; CI, 0.51-0.97), and the CCI (OR, 0.72; 95\% CI, 0.52-1.00). Similarly, decreased survival was associated with decreased thoracic muscle attenuation after adjusting for all of these combinations of covariates (OR, 0.67-0.72; 95\% CI, 0.49-0.99). Decreased lumbar muscle size and attenuation trended with decreased survival but did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION: In older adults with hip fractures, CT findings of decreased thoracic paravertebral muscle size and attenuation are associated with decreased overall survival.},

The examination of the computed tomography scan at the level of the third lumbar vertebra-a common procedure for staging many tumours-has allowed the oncologist to evaluate the muscle mass and to collect many retrospective data on the prevalence of sarcopenia and its clinical consequences. Sarcopenia is a condition affecting a high percentage of patients with a range depending on type of primary tumour and stage of disease. It is noteworthy that patients may be sarcopenic even if their nutritional status is apparently maintained or they are obese. Sarcopenic patients exhibited higher chemotherapy toxicity and poorer compliance with oncological treatments. Furthermore, several antineoplastic drugs appeared to worsen the sarcopenic status. Therapeutic approaches are several and this review will focus on those validated by randomized controlled trials. They include the use of {$\omega$}-3-enriched oral nutritional supplements and orexigenic agents, the administration of adequate high-protein regimens delivered enterally or parenterally, and programmes of physical exercise. Better results are expected combining different procedures in a multimodal approach. In conclusion, there are several premises to prevent/treat sarcopenia. The oncologist should coordinate this multimodal approach by selecting priorities and sequences of treatments and then involving a nutrition health care professional or a physical therapist depending on the condition of the single patient.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: This study investigated the effects of nutritional support on postoperative complications, in relation with demographic and nutritional factors, intraoperative factors, type and routes of nutritional regimens. METHODS: A series of 1410 subjects underwent major abdominal surgery for gastrointestinal cancer and received various types of nutritional support: standard intravenous fluids (SIF; n=149), total parenteral nutrition (TPN; n=368), enteral nutrition (EN; n=393), and immune-enhancing enteral nutrition (IEEN; n=500). Postoperative complications, considered as major (if lethal or requiring re-operation, or transfer to intensive care unit), or otherwise minor, were recorded. RESULTS: Major and minor complications occurred in 101 (7.2\%) and 446 (31.6\%) patients, respectively. Factors correlated with postoperative complications at multivariate analysis were pancreatic surgery, (p{$<$}0.001), advanced age (p=0.002), weight loss (p=0.019), low serum albumin (p=0.019) and nutritional support (p=0.001). Nutritional support reduced morbidity versus SIF with an increasing protective effect of TPN, EN, and IEEN. This effect remained valid regardless the severity of risk factors identified at the multivariate analysis and it was more evident by considering infectious complications only. CONCLUSIONS: Pancreatic surgery, advanced age, weight loss and low serum albumin are independent risk factors for the onset of postoperative complications. Nutritional support, particularly IEEN, significantly reduced postoperative morbidity.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Open transthoracic oesophagectomy is the standard treatment for infracarinal resectable oesophageal carcinomas, although it is associated with high mortality and morbidity rates of 2 to 10\% and 30 to 50\%, respectively, for both the abdominal and thoracic approaches. The worldwide popularity of laparoscopic techniques is based on promising results, including lower postoperative morbidity rates, which are related to the reduced postoperative trauma. We hypothesise that the laparoscopic abdominal approach (laparoscopic gastric mobilisation) in oesophageal cancer surgery will decrease the major postoperative complication rate due to the reduced surgical trauma. METHODS/DESIGN: The MIRO trial is an open, controlled, prospective, randomised multicentre phase III trial. Patients in study arm A will receive laparoscopic-assisted oesophagectomy, i.e., a transthoracic oesophagectomy with two-field lymphadenectomy and laparoscopic gastric mobilisation. Patients in study arm B will receive the same procedure, but with the conventional open abdominal approach. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the major postoperative 30-day morbidity. Secondary objectives are to assess the overall 30-day morbidity, 30-day mortality, 30-day pulmonary morbidity, disease-free survival, overall survival as well as quality of life and to perform medico-economic analysis. A total of 200 patients will be enrolled, and two safety analyses will be performed using 25 and 50 patients included in arm A. DISCUSSION: Postoperative morbidity remains high after oesophageal cancer surgery, especially due to major pulmonary complications, which are responsible for 50\% of the postoperative deaths. This study represents the first randomised controlled phase III trial to evaluate the benefits of the minimally invasive approach with respect to the postoperative course and oncological outcomes in oesophageal cancer surgery.

  abstract = {Objectives\hspace{0.6em} Skeletal muscle mass (SMM) is most often assessed in cancer patients on abdominal computed tomography (CT) imaging at the level of the third lumbar vertebra (L3). Abdominal CT imaging is not routinely performed in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients. Recently, a novel method to assess SMM on a single transversal CT slice at the level of the third cervical vertebra (C3) was published. The objective of this study was to assess the robustness of this novel C3 measurement method in terms of interobserver agreement. Patients and methods\hspace{0.6em} Patients diagnosed with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (LA-HNSCC) at our center between 2007 and 2011 were evaluated. Fifty-four patients with were randomly selected for analysis. Six observers independently measured the cross-sectional muscle area (CSMA) at the level of C3 using a predefined, written protocol as instruction. Interobserver agreement was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), a Bland\textendash Altman plot and Fleiss' kappa ({$\kappa$}). Results\hspace{0.6em} The agreement in vertebra selection between all observers was excellent (Fleiss' {$\kappa$}: 0.96). There was a substantial agreement between all observers in single slice selection (Fleiss' {$\kappa$}: 0.61). For all CSMA measurements, ICCs were excellent (0.763\textendash 0.969; all p\,{$<$}\,0.001). The Bland\textendash Altman plot showed good agreement between measurements, with narrow limits of agreement. Conclusion\hspace{0.6em} Interobserver agreement for SMM measurement at the level of C3 was excellent. Assessment of SMM at the level of C3 is easy and robust and can performed on routinely available imaging in HNC patients.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Body weight scales to height with a power of {$\approx$}2 (weight/height2 ), forming the basis of body mass index (BMI). The corresponding scaling of body composition measured by abdominal computed tomography (CT) to height has not been established. The objective of this analysis was to quantify the scaling of body composition measured by a single-slice axial abdominal CT image (skeletal muscle, and visceral, subcutaneous, and total adipose tissue) to height in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). METHODS: This cross-sectional study included non-Hispanic white males and females, aged 18-80~years, who were diagnosed with stage I-III CRC at an integrated health care system in North America between January 2006 and December 2011. Body composition was measured by a single-slice axial CT image of the third lumbar vertebra and analysed with a semi-automated threshold segmentation procedure. Allometric regression models were used to quantify height scaling powers ({$\beta~\pm~$}standard error) for each body composition measure, adjusted for age, for males and females. An interaction test was used to determine if height scaling powers were statistically significantly different between males and females. RESULTS: Among 2036 subjects, the mean (standard deviation) age was 64~{$\pm~$}11~years, 1008 (49.5\%) were female, and the mean (standard deviation) BMI was 27.9~{$\pm~$}5.4~kg/m2 . Powers for skeletal muscle area were 1.06~{$\pm~$}0.12 for males and 0.80~{$\pm~$}0.12 for females (P~=~0.049). Powers for visceral adipose tissue area were 1.81~{$\pm~$}0.64 for males and 0.57~{$\pm~$}0.79 for females (P~=~0.16). Powers for subcutaneous adipose tissue area were 2.04~{$\pm~$}0.42 for males and 0.81~{$\pm~$}0.45 for females (P~=~0.056). Powers for total abdominal adipose tissue area were 1.80~{$\pm~$}0.46 for males and 0.76~{$\pm~$}0.50 for females (P~=~0.20). CONCLUSIONS: Body composition measured by single-slice axial abdominal CT, particularly muscle area, scales to height with age-adjusted powers that are different than 2 and are distinct between males and females. These observations may have implications for the development of height-adjusted body composition indices in patients with cancer.},

While this condition is associated with a high mortality in cancer patients, its influence on survival is still underestimated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A systematic review for articles was performed using the PubMed database, Cochrane Library, Biomed Central, Science Direct and by manual search. We used data of overall survival in sarcopenic patients for assessing the death risk. We extracted hazard ratio estimates from univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models for meta-analysis. RESULTS: A total of 15 studies were eligible for meta-analysis including a total of 2,521 lung cancer patients. Univariate meta-analysis revealed a two-fold increased death risk in sarcopenic patients; multivariate meta-analysis yielded a significant, three-fold elevated risk of death. This higher mortality is independent of tumour stage. CONCLUSION: Muscle loss is an independent risk factor for increased death risk in lung cancer patients independent of cancer stage. This argues for implementing screening for sarcopenia into cancer care.},

  abstract = {Background Numerous studies have suggested an association between sarcopenia in pancreatic cancer and adverse outcomes. This systematic review examines the evidence for the impact of sarcopenia on post-operative complications and survival Methods A systematic literature search was conducted to identify randomised and non-randomised studies of sarcopenia in pancreatic cancer. Meta-analyses of intra- and post-operative outcomes were performed (operating time, all complications, major complications, pancreatic fistulae, peri-operative mortality, overall survival). Results Forty-two studies reported the assessment of body composition in 7619 patients. Methods used to assess body composition in patients with pancreatic cancers were computerized tomography (n~=~34), bioelectrical impedance analysis (n~=~7), and dual-energy-X-ray-absorptiometry (n~=~1). Only 10 studies reported the impact of pre-operative sarcopenia upon post-operative outcomes. Sarcopenia was associated with increased peri-operative mortality (OR: 2.40, CI95\%:1.19\textendash 4.85, p~{$<~$}0.01) and decreased overall survival by univariable (HR: 1.95, CI95\%:1.35\textendash 2.81, p~{$<~$}0.001) and multivariable analysis (HR: 1.78, CI95\%:1.54\textendash 2.05). Sarcopenia was not significantly associated with all complications (OR: 0.96, CI95\%:0.78\textendash 1.19) or pancreatic fistula (OR: 0.95, CI95\%: 0.59\textendash 1.54). Conclusions Assessment of sarcopenia in pancreatic cancer provides prognostic value but, more importantly, may provide a basis for therapeutic intervention. However, variation in the methods of assessing and reporting sarcopenia in this patient group limits the assessment of post-operative outcomes currently.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A computer system for automated segmentation of truncal musculature groups was designed and created. Abdominal CT scans of 102 sequential patients (mean age 68 years, range 59-81 years; 53 women, 49 men) conducted between January 2015 and February 2015 were assembled as a data set. Truncal musculature was manually segmented on axial CT images at multiple lumbar vertebral levels as reference standard data, divided into training and testing subsets, and analyzed by the system. Dice similarity coefficients were calculated to evaluate system performance. IRB approval was obtained, with waiver of informed consent in this retrospective study. RESULTS: System performance as gauged by the Dice coefficients, for detecting the total abdominal muscle cross-section at the level of the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae, were, respectively, 0.953 {$\pm$} 0.015 and 0.953 {$\pm$} 0.011 for the training set, and 0.938 {$\pm$} 0.028 and 0.940 {$\pm$} 0.026 for the testing set. Dice coefficients for detecting total psoas muscle cross-section at the level of the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae, were, respectively, 0.942 {$\pm$} 0.040 and 0.951 {$\pm$} 0.037 for the training set, and 0.939 {$\pm$} 0.028 and 0.946 {$\pm$} 0.032 for the testing set.

  abstract = {Anemia in cancer patients is quite common, with remarkable negative impacts on quality of life and overall prognosis. The pathogenesis is complex and typically multifactorial, with iron deficiency (ID) often being a major and potentially treatable contributor. In turn, ID in cancer patients can be due to multiple concurring mechanisms, including bleeding (e.g., in gastrointestinal cancers or after surgery), malnutrition, medications, and hepcidin-driven iron sequestration into macrophages with subsequent iron-restricted erythropoiesis. Indeed, either absolute or functional iron deficiency (AID or FID) can occur. While for absolute ID there is a general consensus regarding the laboratory definition (that is ferritin levels {$<$}100 ng/mL {$\pm$} transferrin saturation (TSAT) {$<$}20\%), a shared definition of functional ID is still lacking. Current therapeutic options in cancer anemia include iron replacement, erythropoietic stimulating agents (ESAs), and blood transfusions. The latter should be kept to a minimum, because of concerns regarding risks, costs, and limited resources. Iron therapy has proved to be a valid approach to enhance efficacy of ESAs and to reduce transfusion need. Available guidelines focus mainly on patients with chemotherapy-associated anemia, and generally suggest intravenous (IV) iron when AID or FID is present. However, in the case of FID, the upper limit of ferritin in association with TSAT {$<$}20\% at which iron should be prescribed is a matter of controversy, ranging up to 800 ng/mL. An increasingly recognized indication to IV iron in cancer patients is represented by preoperative anemia in elective oncologic surgery. In this setting, the primary goal of treatment is to decrease the need of blood transfusions in the perioperative period, rather than improving anemia-related symptoms as in chemotherapy-associated anemia. Protocols are mainly based on experiences of Patient Blood Management (PBM) in non-oncologic surgery, but no specific guidelines are available for oncologic surgery. Here we discuss some possible approaches to the management of ID in cancer patients in different clinical settings, based on current guidelines and recommendations, emphasizing the need for further research in the field.},

Sarcopenia was defined using optimal stratification and sex- and BMI-specific cut points. High adiposity was defined as the highest tertile of sex-specific total adipose tissue (TAT). Primary outcomes were overall mortality and colorectal cancer-specific mortality (CRCsM).Results: Slightly over 42\% patients were sarcopenic. During 5.8 years of follow-up, 788 deaths occurred, including 433 from colorectal cancer. Sarcopenic patients had a 27\% [HR, 1.27; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.09-1.48] higher risk of overall mortality than those who were not sarcopenic. Females with both low muscle and high adiposity had a 64\% higher risk of overall mortality (HR, 1.64; 95\% CI, 1.05-2.57) than females with adequate muscle and lower adiposity. The lowest risk of overall mortality was seen in patients with a BMI between 25 and {$<$}30 kg/m2, a range associated with the greatest number of patients (58.6\%) who were not at increased risk of overall mortality due to either low muscle or high adiposity.Conclusions: Sarcopenia is prevalent among patients with non-metastatic colorectal cancer, and should, along with adiposity be a standard oncological marker.Impact: Our findings suggest a biologic explanation for the obesity paradox in colorectal cancer and refute the notion that the association between overweight and lower mortality is due solely to methodologic biases.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Academic Medical Center. PARTICIPANTS: Patients 65 years or older that underwent nonemergency surgery with an inpatient stay 24 hours or more between October 8th, 2017 and June 1st, 2019. EXPOSURES: Frailty as measured by a 54-item electronic frailty index (eFI). OUTCOMES AND MEASUREMENTS: Inpatient length of stay, requirements for post-acute care, 30-day readmission, and 6-month all-cause mortality. RESULTS: Of 4,831 unique patients (2,281 females (47.3\%); mean (SD) age, 73.2 (5.9) years), 4,143 (85.7\%) had sufficient EHR data to calculate the eFI, with 15.1\% categorized as frail (eFI {$>$} 0.21) and 50.9\% pre-frail (0.10 {$<$} eFI {$\leq$} 0.21). For all outcomes, there was a generally a gradation of risk with higher eFI scores. For example, adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and American Society of Anesthesiologists class, and accounting for variability by service line, patients identified as frail based on the eFI, compared to fit patients, had greater needs for post-acute care (odds ratio (OR) = 1.68; 95\% confidence interval (CI) = 1.36\textendash 2.08), higher rates of 30-day readmission (hazard ratio (HR) = 2.46; 95\%CI = 1.72\textendash 3.52) and higher all-cause mortality (HR = 2.86; 95\%CI = 1.84\textendash 4.44) over 6 months' follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The eFI, an automated digital marker for frailty integrated within the EHR, can facilitate pre-operative frailty screening at scale.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A prognostic assessment is crucial for making cancer treatment decisions in older patients. We assessed the prognostic performance (relative to one-year mortality) of eight comorbidity indices in a cohort of older patients with cancer. METHODS: We studied patients with cancer aged {$\geq$}70 included in the Elderly Cancer Patient (ELCAPA) cohort between 2007 and 2010. We assessed seven nonspecific indices (Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), three modified versions of the CCI, the Elixhauser Comorbidity Index, the Gagne index, and the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale for Geriatrics (CIRS-G)) and the National Cancer Institute Comorbidity Index. RESULTS: Overall, 510 patients were included. Among patients with nonmetastatic cancer, all the comorbidity indices were independently associated with 1-year mortality (adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) of 1.44 to 2.51 for one standard deviation increment; p \&lt; 0.05 for all) and had very good discriminant ability (Harrell's C \&gt; 0.8 for the eight indices), but were poorly calibrated. Among patients with metastatic cancer, only the CIRS-G was independently associated with 1-year mortality (aHR (95\% confidence interval): 1.26 [1.06-1.50]). Discriminant ability was moderate (0.61 to 0.70) for the subsets of patients with metastatic cancer and colorectal cancer. CONCLUSION: Comorbidity indices had strong prognostic value and discriminative ability for one-year mortality in older patients with nonmetastatic cancer, although calibration was poor. In older patients with metastatic cancer, only the CIRS-G was predictive of one-year mortality.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) has been developed to overcome the limitations of endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR). We aimed to compare the outcomes of these two methods. METHODS: Databases, including Pubmed, EMBASE, and The Cochrane Library, were searched to identify studies comparing ESD with EMR for premalignant and malignant lesions of the gastrointestinal tract. In a meta-analysis, primary end points were the en bloc resection rate and the curative resection rate; secondary end points were operation time, and rates of bleeding, perforation, and local recurrence. RESULTS: 15 nonrandomized studies (seven full-text and eight abstracts) were identified. Meta-analysis showed higher en bloc and curative resection rates (odds ratio [OR] 13.87, 95 \%CI 10.12 - 18.99; OR 3.53, 95 \%CI 2.57 - 4.84) irrespective of lesion size. Subgroup analysis showed higher en bloc and curative resection rates with ESD for esophageal, gastric, and colorectal neoplasms, and for lesions of size {$<$} 10 mm, 10 mm {$<$} 20 mm, and {$>$} 20 mm. Local recurrence was lower with ESD (OR 0.09, 95 \%CI 0.04 - 0.18). But ESD was more time-consuming than EMR (weighted mean difference [WMD] 1.76; 95 \%CI 0.60 - 2.92), and showed high procedure-related bleeding and perforation rates (OR 2.20, 95 \%CI 1.58 - 3.07; OR 4.09, 95 \%CI 2.47 - 6.80). CONCLUSIONS: ESD showed better en bloc and curative resection rates and local recurrence compared with EMR, but was more time-consuming and had higher rates of bleeding and perforation complications. These results need to be confirmed by high quality trials and further studies in the west.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Feeding jejunostomy is frequently used to ensure nutritional intake after esophagectomy. Early return to diet is demonstrated to enhance recovery in major abdominal surgery. Early oral feeding is safe and effective in recent randomized controlled trials in esophagectomy. This study assesses the implications of eliminating the insertion of jejunostomy after esophagectomy. METHODS: A retrospective study was undertaken between 2014 and 2017 with follow-up over the first year. Fifty patients did not have a jejunostomy, compared with 46 patients who had conventional treatment. Outcomes measured included change in relative weight and body mass over 1 year, complications, and nutritional reinterventions. RESULTS: Median weight loss at 1 year was 10.7 kg (range, -8 to 55.6) whereas median percent weight loss was 12\% (range, -10.1\% to 39.2\%). Patients without jejunostomy lost more weight during the first month (P~= .002). Thereafter, at 6 of 12 months, there were no differences in actual or relative weight loss. Obese patients lost more weight in the group without jejunostomy compared with those who had it (9.9 versus 5 kg; P~= .004). This effect was not seen in normal or overweight patients. Complications were similar, whereas leaks were more common in the jejunostomy group (15.2\% versus 2\%; P~= .019). Nutritional reinterventions were similar during index admission and subsequent readmissions (7 versus 5 patients; P~= .640). CONCLUSIONS: Routine jejunostomy use delays rather than prevents weight loss after esophagectomy. Oral route nutrition allows patients to maintain sufficient nutrition and does not increase complications or requirement for nutritional interventions after surgery. Routine use of jejunostomy may not be required in modern practice.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The hemoglobin threshold at which postoperative red-cell transfusion is warranted is controversial. We conducted a randomized trial to determine whether a higher threshold for blood transfusion would improve recovery in patients who had undergone surgery for hip fracture. METHODS: We enrolled 2016 patients who were 50 years of age or older, who had either a history of or risk factors for cardiovascular disease, and whose hemoglobin level was below 10 g per deciliter after hip-fracture surgery. We randomly assigned patients to a liberal transfusion strategy (a hemoglobin threshold of 10 g per deciliter) or a restrictive transfusion strategy (symptoms of anemia or at physician discretion for a hemoglobin level of {$<$}8 g per deciliter). The primary outcome was death or an inability to walk across a room without human assistance on 60-day follow-up. RESULTS: A median of 2 units of red cells were transfused in the liberal-strategy group and none in the restrictive-strategy group. The rates of the primary outcome were 35.2\% in the liberal-strategy group and 34.7\% in the restrictive-strategy group (odds ratio in the liberal-strategy group, 1.01; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.84 to 1.22), for an absolute risk difference of 0.5 percentage points (95\% CI, -3.7 to 4.7). The rates of in-hospital acute coronary syndrome or death were 4.3\% and 5.2\%, respectively (absolute risk difference, -0.9\%; 99\% CI, -3.3 to 1.6), and rates of death on 60-day follow-up were 7.6\% and 6.6\%, respectively (absolute risk difference, 1.0\%; 99\% CI, -1.9 to 4.0). The rates of other complications were similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: A liberal transfusion strategy, as compared with a restrictive strategy, did not reduce rates of death or inability to walk independently on 60-day follow-up or reduce in-hospital morbidity in elderly patients at high cardiovascular risk.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The optimal haemoglobin threshold for use of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in anaemic patients remains~an active field of research.~Blood is a scarce resource, and in some countries, transfusions are less safe than in others because of inadequate testing for viral pathogens. If a liberal transfusion policy does not improve clinical outcomes, or if it is equivalent, then adopting a more restrictive approach could be recognised as the standard of care.~ OBJECTIVES: The aim of this review update was to compare 30-day mortality and other clinical outcomes for participants randomised to restrictive versus liberal red blood cell (RBC) transfusion thresholds (triggers) for all clinical conditions. The restrictive transfusion threshold uses a lower haemoglobin concentration~as a threshold for~transfusion (most commonly, 7.0 g/dL to 8.0 g/dL), and the liberal transfusion threshold uses a higher haemoglobin concentration as a threshold for transfusion (most commonly, 9.0 g/dL to 10.0 g/dL). SEARCH METHODS: We identified trials~through updated searches: CENTRAL (2020, Issue 11), MEDLINE (1946 to November 2020), Embase (1974 to November 2020), Transfusion Evidence Library (1950 to November 2020), Web of Science Conference Proceedings Citation Index (1990 to~November 2020), and trial registries (November~2020). We~ checked the reference lists of other published reviews and relevant papers to identify additional trials. We were aware of one trial identified in earlier searching that was in the process of being published (in February 2021), and we were able to include it before this review was finalised. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised trials of surgical or medical participants that recruited adults or children, or both. We excluded studies that focused on neonates. Eligible trials assigned intervention groups on the basis of different transfusion schedules or thresholds or 'triggers'. These thresholds would be defined by a haemoglobin (Hb) or haematocrit (Hct) concentration~below which an~RBC~transfusion would be administered; the~haemoglobin concentration remains the most commonly applied marker~of the need for RBC transfusion in clinical practice.~We included trials in which investigators had allocated participants to higher thresholds or more liberal transfusion strategies compared to more restrictive ones, which might include no transfusion. As in previous versions of this review, we did not exclude unregistered trials published after 2010 (as per the policy of the Cochrane Injuries Group, 2015), however, we did conduct analyses to consider the differential impact of results of trials for which prospective registration could not be confirmed. ~ DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We identified trials for inclusion and extracted data using Cochrane methods. We pooled risk ratios of clinical outcomes across trials using a random-effects model. Two review authors~independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We conducted predefined analyses by clinical subgroups. We defined participants randomly allocated to the lower transfusion threshold as being in the 'restrictive transfusion' group and those randomly allocated to the higher transfusion threshold as being in the 'liberal transfusion' group. MAIN RESULTS: A total of~48~trials, involving data from 21,433 participants (at baseline), across a range of clinical contexts (e.g. orthopaedic, cardiac, or vascular surgery; critical care; acute blood loss (including gastrointestinal bleeding); acute coronary syndrome; cancer; leukaemia; haematological malignancies), met the eligibility criteria. The haemoglobin concentration used to define the restrictive transfusion group in most trials (36) was between 7.0 g/dL and 8.0 g/dL. ~Most trials included only adults; three trials focused on children. The included studies were generally at low risk of bias for key domains including allocation concealment and incomplete outcome data. Restrictive transfusion strategies reduced the risk of receiving at least one RBC transfusion by 41\% across a broad range of clinical contexts (risk ratio (RR) 0.59, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 0.66; 42 studies, 20,057~participants; high-quality evidence), with a large amount of heterogeneity between trials (I{$^2$} = 96\%). Overall, restrictive transfusion strategies did not increase or decrease the risk of 30-day mortality compared with liberal transfusion strategies (RR 0.99, 95\% CI 0.86 to 1.15; 31 studies, 16,729 participants; I{$^2$} = 30\%; moderate-quality evidence) or any of the other outcomes assessed (i.e. cardiac events (low-quality evidence), myocardial infarction, stroke, thromboembolism (all high-quality evidence)). High-quality evidence shows that the liberal transfusion threshold did not affect the risk of infection (pneumonia, wound infection, or bacteraemia). Transfusion-specific reactions are uncommon and were inconsistently reported within trials. We noted less certainty in the strength of evidence to support the safety of restrictive transfusion thresholds for the following predefined clinical subgroups: myocardial infarction, vascular surgery, haematological malignancies, and chronic bone-marrow disorders. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Transfusion~at a restrictive haemoglobin concentration decreased the proportion of people exposed to RBC transfusion by 41\% across a broad range of clinical contexts. Across all trials, no evidence suggests that a restrictive transfusion strategy impacted~30-day mortality, mortality at other time points, or morbidity (i.e. cardiac events, myocardial infarction, stroke, pneumonia, thromboembolism, infection) compared with a liberal transfusion strategy. Despite including 17 more randomised trials (and 8846 participants), data remain insufficient to inform the safety of transfusion policies in important and selected clinical contexts, such as myocardial infarction, chronic cardiovascular disease, neurological injury or traumatic brain injury, stroke, thrombocytopenia, and cancer or haematological malignancies, including chronic~bone marrow failure.~ Further work is needed to improve our understanding of outcomes other than mortality.~Most trials compared only two~separate thresholds for haemoglobin concentration, which may not identify the~actual optimal threshold for transfusion in a particular patient. Haemoglobin concentration may not be the most informative marker of the need for transfusion in individual patients with different degrees of physiological adaptation to anaemia. Notwithstanding these issues, overall findings provide good evidence that transfusions with allogeneic RBCs can be avoided in most patients with haemoglobin thresholds between the range of 7.0 g/dL and 8.0 g/dL.~Some patient subgroups~might benefit from RBCs~to maintain higher haemoglobin concentrations; research efforts should focus on these clinical contexts.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Postoperative pulmonary complications can be a devastating consequence of surgery. Validated strategies to reduce these adverse outcomes are needed. OBJECTIVES: To design, implement, and determine the efficacy of a suite of interventions for reducing postoperative pulmonary complications. DESIGN: A before-after trial comparing our National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) pulmonary outcomes before and after implementing I COUGH, a multidisciplinary pulmonary care program. SETTING: An urban, academic, safety-net hospital. PARTICIPANTS: All patients who underwent general or vascular surgery at our institution during a 1-year period before and after implementation of I COUGH. INTERVENTIONS: A multidisciplinary team developed a strategy to reduce pulmonary complications based on comprehensive patient and family education and a set of standardized electronic physician orders to specify early postoperative mobilization and pulmonary care. Designated by the acronym I COUGH, the program emphasizes incentive spirometry, coughing and deep breathing, oral care (brushing teeth and using mouthwash twice daily), understanding (patient and family education), getting out of bed at least 3 times daily, and head-of-bed elevation. Nursing and physician education promoted a culture of mobilization and I COUGH interventions. I COUGH was implemented for all general surgery and vascular surgery patients at our institution in August 2010. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The NSQIP-reported incidence and risk-adjusted ratios of postoperative pneumonia and unplanned intubation, which NSQIP reports as observed-expected (OE) ratios for the 1-year period before implementing I COUGH and as odds ratios (ORs, statistically comparable to OE ratios) for the period after its implementation. RESULTS: Before implementation of I COUGH, our incidence of postoperative pneumonia was 2.6\%, falling to 1.6\% after its implementation, and risk-adjusted outcomes fell from an OE ratio of 2.13 to an OR of 1.58. The incidence of unplanned intubations was 2.0\% before I COUGH and 1.2\% after I COUGH, with risk-adjusted outcomes decreasing from an OE ratio of 2.10 to an OR of 1.31. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: I COUGH, a standardized postoperative care program emphasizing patient education, early mobilization, and pulmonary interventions, reduced the incidence of postoperative pneumonia and unplanned intubation among our patients.},

The aim of this study was to compare the outcome of patients who had clinical complete response(CR) with neoadjuvant CT-RT + oesophagectomy with the survival of patients who had clinical CR and were not operated on. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-seven consecutive patients with SCC of the thoracic oesophagus with CR with neoadjuvant CT-RT presenting at the Regional Center of Esophageal Diseases from 1992 to 2008 were included in this retrospective study on a prospectively collected database. Thirty-nine patients underwent oesophagectomy (CT-RT + oesophagectomy), while 38(CT-RT) were not operated on because they were considered unfit for surgery or refused the operation. Patients' outcome and survival were compared. RESULTS: In the CT-RT + oesophagectomy group, clinical CR was confirmed after histological examination of the surgical specimen in 27/39 (69.2 \%) patients. Five-year overall survival rates were 50.0 \% in the CT-RT + oesophagectomy group and 57.0 \% in the CT-RT group (p=0.99); 5-year disease-free survival rates were 55.5\%in the CT-RT + oesophagectomy group and 34.6\%in the CTRT group (p=0.15). Even after adjusting for propensity score, age, ASA and clinical stage, the treatment regimen did not show a statistically significant effect on overall survival (adjusted p=0.65) nor on disease-free survival (adjusted p=0.15). CONCLUSION: In our group of patients with clinical CR after neoadjuvant CT-RT for SCC of the thoracic oesophagus, waiting for recurrence and then using salvage surgery did not negatively impact their survival compared to patients treated with surgery. More accurate restaging protocols are warranted to improve decision making after CR with neoadjuvant CT-RT.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Blood transfusion is still common in patients undergoing major cancer surgery. Blood transfusion can be associated with poor prognosis in patients with cancer. Perioperative Care in the Cancer Patient -1 (ARCA-1) aims to assess in a large cohort of patients the current incidence, pattern of practice and associations between perioperative blood transfusions and 1-year survival in patients undergoing major cancer surgery. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: ARCA-1 is a prospective international multicentre observational study that will include adult patients scheduled to have major cancer surgical procedures with the intention to cure, and an overnight planned hospital admission. The study will be opened for 1\,year for enrolment (7 January 2020-7 February 2021). Each centre will enrol patients for 30 days. The primary endpoint of this study is all-cause mortality 1\,year after major cancer surgery. Secondary endpoints are rate of perioperative blood product use, cancer-specific mortality at 1 year and PFSs and 30-day morbidity and mortality. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at The University of Texas-MD Anderson Cancer Center. The study results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and disseminated at international conferences. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT04491409.},

  abstract = {RATIONALE: This initiative is focused on building a global consensus around core diagnostic criteria for malnutrition in adults in clinical settings. METHODS: In January 2016, the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) was convened by several of the major global clinical nutrition societies. GLIM appointed a core leadership committee and a supporting working group with representatives bringing additional global diversity and expertise. Empirical consensus was reached through a series of face-to-face meetings, telephone conferences, and e-mail communications. RESULTS: A two-step approach for the malnutrition diagnosis was selected, i.e., first screening to identify "at risk" status by the use of any validated screening tool, and second, assessment for diagnosis and grading the severity of malnutrition. The malnutrition criteria for consideration were retrieved from existing approaches for screening and assessment. Potential criteria were subjected to a ballot among the GLIM core and supporting working group members. The top five ranked criteria included three phenotypic criteria (non-volitional weight loss, low body mass index, and reduced muscle mass) and two etiologic criteria (reduced food intake or assimilation, and inflammation or disease burden). To diagnose malnutrition at least one phenotypic criterion and one etiologic criterion should be present. Phenotypic metrics for grading severity as Stage 1 (moderate) and Stage 2 (severe) malnutrition are proposed. It is recommended that the etiologic criteria be used to guide intervention and anticipated outcomes. The recommended approach supports classification of malnutrition into four etiology-related diagnosis categories. CONCLUSION: A consensus scheme for diagnosing malnutrition in adults in clinical settings on a global scale is proposed. Next steps are to secure further collaboration and endorsements from leading nutrition professional societies, to identify overlaps with syndromes like cachexia and sarcopenia, and to promote dissemination, validation studies, and feedback. The diagnostic construct should be re-considered every 3-5 years.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiation followed by surgical resection of the rectum is a standard treatment for locally advanced rectal cancer. A subset of rectal cancer is caused by a deficiency in mismatch repair. Because mismatch repair-deficient colorectal cancer is responsive to programmed death 1 (PD-1) blockade in the context of metastatic disease, it was hypothesized that checkpoint blockade could be effective in patients with mismatch repair-deficient, locally advanced rectal cancer. METHODS: We initiated a prospective phase 2 study in which single-agent dostarlimab, an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, was administered every 3 weeks for 6 months in patients with mismatch repair-deficient stage II or III rectal adenocarcinoma. This treatment was to be followed by standard chemoradiotherapy and surgery. Patients who had a clinical complete response after completion of dostarlimab therapy would proceed without chemoradiotherapy and surgery. The primary end points are sustained clinical complete response 12 months after completion of dostarlimab therapy or pathological complete response after completion of dostarlimab therapy with or without chemoradiotherapy and overall response to neoadjuvant dostarlimab therapy with or without chemoradiotherapy. RESULTS: A total of 12 patients have completed treatment with dostarlimab and have undergone at least 6 months of follow-up. All 12 patients (100\%; 95\% confidence interval, 74 to 100) had a clinical complete response, with no evidence of tumor on magnetic resonance imaging, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron-emission tomography, endoscopic evaluation, digital rectal examination, or biopsy. At the time of this report, no patients had received chemoradiotherapy or undergone surgery, and no cases of progression or recurrence had been reported during follow-up (range, 6 to 25 months). No adverse events of grade 3 or higher have been reported. CONCLUSIONS: Mismatch repair-deficient, locally advanced rectal cancer was highly sensitive to single-agent PD-1 blockade. Longer follow-up is needed to assess the duration of response. (Funded by the Simon and Eve Colin Foundation and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04165772.).},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: For many chemotherapy regimens dosed based on body surface area (BSA), patients experience dose reductions or delays or discontinue treatment, thereby reducing survival. Consideration of body composition may be useful in individualizing chemotherapy dosing, but to the authors' knowledge few studies to date have examined the association of body composition with chemotherapy tolerance in patients with colon cancer. METHODS: The authors identified patients with nonmetastatic colon cancer who were diagnosed from 2006 through 2011 at Kaiser Permanente and who received leucovorin calcium/calcium folinate, 5-fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) as initial adjuvant chemotherapy (533 patients). Patients' muscle mass was quantified using clinically acquired computed tomography scans. The authors quantified chemotherapy doses, treatment dates, and related toxicities using the electronic medical record. In logistic regression models adjusting for age, sex, and American Joint Committee on Cancer stage of disease, the authors examined associations of muscle tertiles with early treatment discontinuation ({$<$}6 cycles), treatment delay ({$>$}3 days off schedule for {$\geq$}3 times), and/or dose reduction (relative dose intensity\,{$\leq$}\,0.70, based on planned treatment). RESULTS: The average age of the patients at the time of diagnosis was 58.7 years; BSA was 1.9\,m2 and body mass index was 28.7\,kg/m2 . Compared with the highest sex-specific tertile of muscle mass, patients in the lowest tertile were more likely to experience toxicities and had twice the risk of adverse outcomes while receiving FOLFOX; for early discontinuation, the odds ratio (OR) was 2.34 (95\% confidence interval [95\% CI], 1.04-5.24; P for trend\,=\,.03), whereas the ORs were 2.24 (95\% CI, 1.37-3.66; P for trend\,=\,.002) for treatment delay and 2.28 (95\% CI, 1.19-4.36; P for trend\,=\,.01) for dose reduction. CONCLUSIONS: Lower muscle mass is associated with greater toxicity and poor chemotherapy adherence among patients receiving FOLFOX. Many chemotherapy drugs are dosed based on BSA, but treatment may be better individualized if muscle mass is considered. Cancer 2017;123:4868-77. \textcopyright{} 2017 American Cancer Society.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients diagnosed with mCC from 2009 to 2010 in British Columbia, Canada were reviewed and categorized as elderly patients (age~{$\geq$} 70 years) and young patients (age~{$<$} 70 years). Cox regression models adjusted for age and confounders were used to determine the effect of systemic therapy on OS. RESULTS: We identified 1013 patients with a median age of 67 years. Of the 1013 patients, 42\% were elderly and 58\% were young; 57\% were men; and 66\% had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 0 or 1. Fewer elderly patients were offered systemic therapy compared with young patients (48\% vs. 77\%; P~{$<$} .001). Among those treated, elderly patients were less likely than young patients to receive combination chemotherapy (47\% vs. 81\%; P~{$<$} .0001) and bevacizumab (19\% vs. 47\%; P~{$<$} .0001). The most common reasons for no treatment were similar for the elderly and young patients: patient choice, poor ECOG PS, and significant comorbidities. Advanced age alone was also cited as a reason for elderly but not for young patients (7\% vs. 0\%). When treated, the risk of adverse events and treatment interruptions was comparable between age groups. The receipt of systemic therapy was associated with improved OS in both elderly (hazard ratio [HR], 0.45; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.37-0.56; P~{$<$} .0001) and young (HR, 0.43; 95\% CI, 0.35-0.53; P~{$<$} .0001) patients, regardless of age (interaction P {$>$} .05). CONCLUSION: In carefully selected elderly patients, the outcomes from systemic therapy were comparable to those for young patients. Thus, age alone should not be a barrier to treatment of mCC.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The prognostic value of body composition in cancer patients has been widely studied during the last decade. The main finding of these studies is that sarcopenia, or skeletal muscle depletion, assessed by CT imaging correlates with a reduced overall survival (OS). By contrast, the prognostic value of fat mass remains ill-defined. This study aims to analyze the influence of body composition including both muscle mass and adipose tissue on OS in a homogeneous population of advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. METHODS: Among 235 patients with chemorefractory advanced CRC included in the SoMore and RegARd-C trials, body composition was assessed in 217 patients on baseline CT images. The relationship between body composition (sarcopenia, muscle density, subcutaneous and visceral fat index and density), body mass index (BMI) and OS were evaluated. RESULTS: Patients with a higher BMI had a better OS ({$\geq$}30 versus {$<$}\,30, HR: 0.50; 0.33-0.76). Those with low muscle index and muscle density had an increased mortality (HR: 2.06; 1.45-2.93 and HR: 1.54; 1.09-2.18, respectively). Likewise, low subcutaneous and visceral fat index were associated with an increased risk of dying (HR: 1.63; 1.23-2.17 and 1.48; 1.09-2.02 respectively), as were a high subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue density (HR: 1.93; 1.44-2.57 and 2.40; 1.79-3.20 respectively). In multivariate analysis, a high visceral fat density was the main predictor of poor survival. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm the protective role of obesity in CRC patients at an advanced stage, as well as the negative prognostic impact of muscle depletion on survival. More importantly, our data show for the first time that visceral adipose tissue density is an important prognostic factor in metastatic CRC.

METHODS: In a multicentre, single-arm open study, patients with proved oesophageal cancer without definite distant metastases and regarded as suitable for potentially curative treatment were examined by PET. Clinicians were requested to supply a management plan before and another plan after being supplied with the PET scan results. Patients were followed for at least 1 year for outcome analysis. RESULTS: A total of 129 patients (104 men, mean age 67 y) were recruited. PET detected additional sites of disease in 53 patients (41\%). Significant changes in management (high or medium impact) were observed in 38\% of patients, primarily as a result of identifying additional sites of disease and/or confirming previously equivocal regional and distant metastases. Progression-free survival was significantly shorter in patients found to have additional lesions on PET (p {$<$} 0.05), but was not related to SUV(max). CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate the significant impact of PET on the clinical management of patients with newly diagnosed oesophageal carcinoma, and on prognostic stratification of these patients.},

We aimed to evaluate factors that may contribute to the age disparity of survival improvement among patients with colon cancer. Using data from the National Cancer Database, we identified patients diagnosed with colon cancer between 2004 and 2012 with follow-up data up to 2017. The hazard ratios (HR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) for 5-year OS associated with study variables were estimated using multivariable Cox regression. Among 486,284 patients included in this study, elderly patients (aged {$\geq$}75) had a lower adherence to National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) treatment guidelines (\% of non-adherence: 45.3\%) than younger patients (aged {$<$}50, 19.3\%; P{$<$}0.001). After adjusting for demographics, access to care and clinical characteristics, compared with patients diagnosed between 2004 and 2006, younger and older patients diagnosed between 2010 and 2012 experienced 16\% (HR: 0.84, 95\% CI: 0.81-0.88) and 6\% (HR: 0.94, 95\% CI: 0.93-0.95) reductions in mortality (P for interaction=1.42\texttimes 10-5), respectively. After an additional adjustment for guideline adherence status, no significant difference in the improvement of survival was noted (P for interaction=0.17). The association patterns were similar regardless of tumor stage, race, and high comorbidity scores (all P for interaction{$>$}0.05). Several patient-related factors were identified in association with noncompliance to NCCN guidelines, including comorbidity status. However, over 60\% of noncompliance elderly patients had a Charlson comorbidity score of 0. The observed age disparity in survival improvement among colon cancer patients was primarily explained by a slower improvement in adherence to NCCN treatment guidelines in elderly than younger patients. Many older adults were not receiving recommended therapies despite minimal comorbidities. Our findings call for measures to increase adherence to treatment guidelines among elderly patients to improve survival.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The present study was done to establish a prognostic model for patients and trials using an oxaliplatin-based or irinotecan-based first-line chemotherapy in metastatic colorectal cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eight hundred three patients treated with FOLFOX or FOLFIRI in three prospective trials were randomly separated into learning (n = 535) and validation (n = 268) samples. Eleven baseline variables were evaluated in univariate and multivariate analysis as prognostic factors for overall survival, and a prognostic score was developed. RESULTS: Independent prognostic factors identified in multivariate analysis for overall survival were performance status (PS) (p {$<$} .001), serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (p {$<$} .001), and number of metastatic sites (p = .005). A prognostic score based on these three variables was found efficient (Harrell's C index 0.61). This new model was improved by selecting only PS and LDH (Harrell's C index 0.64). Three risk groups for death could be identified: a low-risk group (n = 184; median overall survival [OS] 29.8 months), an intermediate-risk group (n = 223; median OS 19.5 months), and a high-risk group (n = 128; median OS 13.9 months). Median survival for the low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups were 26.8, 21.1, and 16.5 months, respectively, in the validation sample (Harrell's C index 0.63). CONCLUSIONS: Serum LDH level was the main prognostic factor in predicting survival, followed by WHO PS. We identified three risk groups for death depending on these two baseline parameters. This simple prognostic model can be useful for clinician's use and patient stratification in future clinical trials.},

METHODS: The authors studied 235 consecutive patients with pretherapy clinical Stage II, III, or IVA (according to American Joint Committee on Cancer criteria) carcinoma of the esophagus or esophagogastric junction who were treated with chemoradiation followed by esophagectomy. Posttherapy cancer status was classified using pathologic stage and semiquantitative assessment of residual carcinoma. Clinicopathologic features, residual carcinoma status, and pretherapy and posttherapy stage were compared with disease-free and overall survival. RESULTS: Posttherapy pathologic stage was Stage 0 in 29\% of patients, Stage I in 11\% of patients, Stage II in 34\% of patients, Stage III in 20\% of patients, and Stage IV in 6\% of patients. Cancer downstaging occurred in 56\% of patients. In univariate analysis, disease-free and overall survival were predicted by posttherapy pathologic stage (both with P {$<$} 0.001), margin status (P = 0.002 and P = 0.01, respectively), extent of residual carcinoma (both with P {$<$} 0.001), and downstaging (both with P = 0.001), but not by age, gender, type of cancer, pretherapy clinical stage, or preoperative regimen. However, in multivariate analysis, disease-free and overall survival were independently predicted by posttherapy pathologic stage (both with P = 0.02). Extent of residual carcinoma was a marginally significant predictor of overall survival (P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Posttherapy pathologic stage was the best available predictor of outcome for patients with locoregional carcinoma of the esophagus or esophagogastric junction who underwent chemoradiation therapy followed by esophagectomy. The findings in the current study supported the concept of downstaging by preoperative therapy.},

From July 2000 to December 2004, 80 patients with potentially resectable squamous cell carcinoma of the mid or lower thoracic esophagus were randomized to esophagectomy or chemoradiotherapy. A two-or three-stage esophagectomy with two-field dissection was performed. Patients treated with chemoradiotherapy received continuous 5-.uorouracil infusion (200 mg/m2/day) from day 1 to 42 and cisplatin (60 mg/m2) on days 1 and 22. The tumor and regional lymphatics were concomitantly irradiated to a total of 50\textendash 60 Gy.Tumor response was assessed by endoscopy, endoscopic ultrasonography, and computed tomography scan. Salvage esophagectomy was performed for incomplete response or recurrence. Forty-four patients received standard esophagectomy, whereas 36 were treated with chemoradiotherapy. Median follow-up was 16.9 months. The operative mortality was 6.8\%. The incidence of postoperative complications was 38.6\%. No difference in the early cumulative survival was found between the two groups (RR = 0.89; 95\% confidence interval, 0.37-2.17; log-rank test P =0.45). There was no difference in the disease-free survival. Patients treated with surgery had a slightly higher proportion of recurrence in the mediastinum, whereas those treated with chemoradiation sustained a higher proportion of recurrence in the cervical or abdominal regions. Standard esophagectomy or chemoradiotherapy offered similar early clinical outcome and survival for patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus. The challenge lies in the detection of residue disease after chemoradiotherapy.},

Using 'prehabilitation' to increase activity levels and fitness may affect physiology, postoperative outcomes and improve patient wellbeing and quality of life. The aims of the trial were to address the feasibility and acceptability of recruiting participants to a home-based prehabilitation programme and provide data to allow design of future studies. METHODS: We recruited patients to a single-arm feasibility trial of home-based exercise prehabilitation. Eligible patients were aged {$\geq$}18years, had operable oesophageal or gastric adenocarcinoma and were receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy at our tertiary referral hospital. All participants commenced a home-based exercise programme utilising pedometers and step counting to target daily aerobic exercise sessions alongside daily strengthening exercises. A weekly telephone consultation directed the exercise programme and facilitated weekly data collection. The primary (feasibility) outcomes for the trial were (a) recruitment rate, (b) completion rate, (c) engagement with the programme (use of pedometers, recording step counts, telephone consultations) and (d) compliance with exercise sessions, exercise intensity and strengthening exercises. RESULTS: There were 42 patients recruited, and the recruitment rate was 72.4\% (42/58). 92.3\% (36/39) of patients completed the exercise programme. There was 98.7\% (IQR 93.2-100.0\%) compliance with wearing a pedometer and recording data, and 100.0\% (IQR 93.1-100.0\%) compliance with a weekly telephone consultation. Exercise sessions and strengthening exercises were completed 70.2\% (IQR 53.1-88.9\%) and 69.4\% (IQR 52.1-84.3\%) of the time, respectively. Appropriate exercise intensity was recorded 96\% (IQR 85.4-99.4\%) of the time. There were no adverse events. Participants were enrolled in the exercise programme for a median of 91 days (IQR 84 to 105 days). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this trial support the feasibility and acceptability of recruiting participants to an appropriately powered randomised controlled trial of prehabilitation.

We investigated whether sarcopenia at diagnosis and loss of skeletal muscle during palliative chemotherapy were associated with survival in patients with pancreatic cancer. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical outcomes of pancreatic cancer patients receiving palliative chemotherapy between 2003 and 2010. The cross-sectional area of skeletal muscle at L3 by computed tomography was analyzed with Rapidia 3D software. We defined sarcopenia as a skeletal muscle index (SMI){$<$} 42.2 cm2/m2 (male) and {$<$} 33.9 cm2/m2 (female) using ROC curve. RESULTS: Among 484 patients, 103 (21.3\%) patients were sarcopenic at diagnosis. Decrease in SMI during chemotherapy was observed in 156 (60.9\%) male and 65 (40.6\%) female patients. Decrease in body mass index (BMI) was observed in 149 patients (37.3\%), with no gender difference. By multivariate analysis, sarcopenia (P{$<$} 0.001), decreasedBMI and SMI during chemotherapy (P = 0.002, P = 0.004, respectively) were poor prognostic factors for overall survival (OS). While the OS of male patients was affected with sarcopenia (P{$<$} 0.001) and decreased SMI (P = 0.001), the OS of female patients was influenced with overweight at diagnosis (P = 0.006), decreased BMI (P = 0.032) and decreased SMI (P = 0.014). Particularly, while the change of BMI during chemotherapy did not have impact on OS within the patients with maintained SMI (P = 0.750), decrease in SMI was associated with poor OS within the patients with maintained BMI (HR 1.502; P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Sarcopenia at diagnosis and depletion of skeletal muscle, independent of BMI change, during chemotherapy were poor prognostic factors in advanced pancreatic cancer.},

DESIGN: Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. SETTING: Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library searches were performed up to 15 June 2016. PATIENTS: Trials had to enroll adult surgical or critically ill patients for inclusion. INTERVENTIONS: Studies had to compare a liberal versus restrictive threshold for the transfusion of allogeneic packed RBCs. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality, sub-grouped by surgical and critical care patients. Secondary outcomes included myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, allogeneic blood exposure, and length of stay. Odds ratios and weighted mean differences were calculated using random effects meta-analysis. To assess whether subgroups were significantly different, tests for subgroup interaction were used. Subgroup analysis by trials enrolling critically ill versus surgical patients was performed. Twenty-seven randomized controlled trials (10,797 patients) were included. In critical care patients, restrictive transfusion resulted in significantly reduced 30-day mortality compared with liberal transfusion (odds ratio, 0.82; 95\% CI, 0.70-0.97). In surgical patients, a restrictive transfusion strategy led to the opposite direction of effect for mortality (odds ratio, 1.31; 95\% CI, 0.94-1.82). The subgroup interaction test was significant (p = 0.04), suggesting that the effect of restrictive transfusion on mortality is statistically different for critical care (decreased risk) versus surgical patients (potentially increased risk or no difference). Regarding secondary outcomes, for critically ill patients, a restrictive strategy resulted in reduced risk of stroke/transient ischemic attack, packed RBC exposure, transfusion reactions, and hospital length of stay. In surgical patients, restrictive transfusion resulted in reduced packed RBC exposure. CONCLUSIONS: The safety of restrictive transfusion strategies likely differs for critically ill patients versus perioperative patients. Further trials investigating transfusion strategies in the perioperative setting are necessary.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Muscle dysfunction is a prevalent phenomenon in the oncology setting where patients across a wide range of diagnoses are subject to impaired muscle function regardless of tumor stage and nutritional state. Here, we review the current evidence describing the degree, causes and clinical implications of muscle dysfunction in cancer patients. The efficacy of exercise training to prevent and/or mitigate cancer-related muscle dysfunction is also discussed. DESIGN: We identified 194 studies examining muscular outcomes in cancer patients by searching PubMed and EMBASE databases. RESULTS: Muscle dysfunction is evident across all stages of the cancer trajectory. The causes of cancer-related muscle dysfunction are complex, but may involve a wide range of tumor-, therapy- and/or lifestyle-related factors, depending on the clinical setting of the individual patient. The main importance of muscle dysfunction in cancer patients lies in the correlation to vital clinical end points such as cancer-specific and all-cause mortality, therapy complications and quality of life (QoL). Such associations strongly emphasize the need for effective therapeutic countermeasures to be developed and implemented in oncology practice. Significant progress has been made over the last decade in the field of exercise oncology, indicating that exercise training constitutes a potent modulator of skeletal muscle function in patients with cancer. CONCLUSION: There are clear associations between muscle dysfunction and critical clinical end points. Yet there is a discrepancy between timing of exercise intervention trials, which can improve muscle function, and study populations in whom muscle function are proven prognostic important for clinical end points. Thus, future exercise trials should in early-stage patients, be powered to evaluate clinical outcomes associated with improvements in muscle function, or be promoted in advanced stage settings, aiming to reverse cancer-related muscle dysfunction, and thus potentially improve time-to-progression, treatment toxicity and survival.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence suggests that social factors and problems with physical and cognitive function may contribute to patients' rehospitalization risk. Understanding a patient's readmission risk may help healthcare providers develop tailored treatment and post-discharge care plans to reduce readmission and mortality. This study aimed to evaluate whether including patient-reported data on social factors; cognitive status; and physical function improves on a predictive model based on electronic health record (EHR) data alone. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study of 1,547 hospitalized adult patients in 3 Kaiser Permanente Northern California hospitals. The main outcomes were non-elective rehospitalization or death within 30~days post-discharge. Exposures included patient-reported social factors and cognitive and physical function (obtained in a pre-discharge interview) and EHR-derived data for comorbidity burden, acute physiology, care directives, prior utilization, and hospital length of stay. We performed bivariate comparisons using Chi-square, t-tests, and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests and assessed correlations between continuous variables using Spearman's rho statistic. For all models, the results reported were obtained after fivefold cross validation. RESULTS: The 1,547 adult patients interviewed were younger (age, p\,=\,0.03) and sicker (COPS2, p\,{$<$}\,0.0001) than the rest of the hospitalized population. Of the 6 patient-reported social factors measured, 3 (not living with a spouse/partner, transportation difficulties, health or disability-related limitations in daily activities) were significantly associated (p\,{$<$}\,0.05) with the main outcomes, while 3 (living situation concerns, problems with food availability, financial problems) were not. Patient-reported cognitive (p\,=\,0.027) and physical function (p\,=\,0.01) were significantly lower in patients with the main outcomes. None of the patient-reported variables, singly or in combination, improved predictive performance of a model that included acute physiology and longitudinal comorbidity burden (area under the receiver operator characteristic curve was 0.716 for both the EHR model and maximal performance of a random forest model including all predictors). CONCLUSIONS: In this insured population, incorporating patient-reported social factors and measures of cognitive and physical function did not improve performance of an EHR-based model predicting 30-day non-elective rehospitalization or mortality. While incorporating patient-reported social and functional status data did not improve ability to predict these outcomes, such data may still be important for improving patient outcomes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: frailty is an especially problematic expression of population ageing. International guidelines recommend routine identification of frailty to provide evidence-based treatment, but currently available tools require additional resource. OBJECTIVES: to develop and validate an electronic frailty index (eFI) using routinely available primary care electronic health record data. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: retrospective cohort study. Development and internal validation cohorts were established using a randomly split sample of the ResearchOne primary care database. External validation cohort established using THIN database. PARTICIPANTS: patients aged 65-95, registered with a ResearchOne or THIN practice on 14 October 2008. PREDICTORS: we constructed the eFI using the cumulative deficit frailty model as our theoretical framework. The eFI score is calculated by the presence or absence of individual deficits as a proportion of the total possible. Categories of fit, mild, moderate and severe frailty were defined using population quartiles. OUTCOMES: outcomes were 1-, 3- and 5-year mortality, hospitalisation and nursing home admission. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated using bivariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. Discrimination was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Calibration was assessed using pseudo-R(2) estimates. RESULTS: we include data from a total of 931,541 patients. The eFI incorporates 36 deficits constructed using 2,171 CTV3 codes. One-year adjusted HR for mortality was 1.92 (95\% CI 1.81-2.04) for mild frailty, 3.10 (95\% CI 2.91-3.31) for moderate frailty and 4.52 (95\% CI 4.16-4.91) for severe frailty. Corresponding estimates for hospitalisation were 1.93 (95\% CI 1.86-2.01), 3.04 (95\% CI 2.90-3.19) and 4.73 (95\% CI 4.43-5.06) and for nursing home admission were 1.89 (95\% CI 1.63-2.15), 3.19 (95\% CI 2.73-3.73) and 4.76 (95\% CI 3.92-5.77), with good to moderate discrimination but low calibration estimates. CONCLUSIONS: the eFI uses routine data to identify older people with mild, moderate and severe frailty, with robust predictive validity for outcomes of mortality, hospitalisation and nursing home admission. Routine implementation of the eFI could enable delivery of evidence-based interventions to improve outcomes for this vulnerable group.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia, loss of muscle mass and strength, has been associated with more frequent complications after esophagectomy. This study compared hand-grip strength, muscle mass, and intramuscular adipose tissue as predictors of postoperative outcomes and mortality after esophagectomy. METHODS: Minimally invasive esophagectomy was performed on 175 patients with esophageal cancer. Skeletal muscle index and skeletal muscle density were derived from preoperative CTs. Hand-grip strength was measured using dynamometer. Univariate and multivariable analyses were performed. RESULTS: Preoperative hand-grip strength was normal in 91 (52\%), intermediate in 43 (25\%), and weak in 41 (23\%) patients. Hand-grip strength was significantly correlated with both skeletal muscle index and skeletal muscle density. Postoperative pneumonia occurred in 8/41 (20\%) patients with weak strength compared to 4/91 (4\%) with normal strength (p\,=\,0.006; Cochran-Armitage Test). Prolonged postoperative ventilation occurred in 11/41 (27\%) patients with weak strength compared to 11/91 (12\%) with normal strength (p\,=\,0.036). Median length of stay was 9~days in patients with weak strength compared to 7~days for those with normal strength (p\,=\,0.005; Kruskal-Wallis Test). Discharge to non-home location occurred in 15/41 (37\%) with weak strength compared to 8/91 (9\%) with normal strength (p\,{$<$}\,0.001). Postoperative mortality at 90~days was 4/41 (10\%) with weak strength compared with no mortalities (0/91) in the normal strength group (p\,=\,0.004). Mortality at 1~year was 18/39 (46\%) in patients with weak strength compared to 6/81 (7\%) with normal strength, among 158 patients with 1-year follow-up (p\,{$<$}\,0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative hand-grip strength was found to be a powerful predictor of postoperative pneumonia, length of stay, discharge to non-home location, and mortality after esophagectomy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer with chemoradiotherapy, surgery, and adjuvant chemotherapy controls local disease, but distant metastases remain common. We aimed to assess whether administering neoadjuvant chemotherapy before preoperative chemoradiotherapy could reduce the risk of distant recurrences. METHODS: We did a phase 3, open-label, multicentre, randomised trial at 35 hospitals in France. Eligible patients were adults aged 18-75 years and had newly diagnosed, biopsy-proven, rectal adenocarcinoma staged cT3 or cT4 M0, with a WHO performance status of 0-1. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to either the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group or standard-of-care group, using an independent web-based system by minimisation method stratified by centre, extramural extension of the tumour into perirectal fat according to MRI, tumour location, and stage. Investigators and participants were not masked to treatment allocation. The neoadjuvant chemotherapy group received neoadjuvant chemotherapy with FOLFIRINOX (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2, irinotecan 180 mg/m2, leucovorin 400 mg/m2, and fluorouracil 2400 mg/m2 intravenously every 14 days for 6 cycles), chemoradiotherapy (50 Gy during 5 weeks and 800 mg/m2 concurrent oral capecitabine twice daily for 5 days per week), total mesorectal excision, and adjuvant chemotherapy (3 months of modified FOLFOX6 [intravenous oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 and leucovorin 400 mg/m2, followed by intravenous 400 mg/m2 fluorouracil bolus and then continuous infusion at a dose of 2400 mg/m2 over 46 h every 14 days for six cycles] or capecitabine [1250 mg/m2 orally twice daily on days 1-14 every 21 days]). The standard-of-care group received chemoradiotherapy, total mesorectal excision, and adjuvant chemotherapy (for 6 months). The primary endpoint was disease-free survival assessed in the intention-to-treat population at 3 years. Safety analyses were done on treated patients. This trial was registered with EudraCT (2011-004406-25) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01804790) and is now complete. FINDINGS: Between June 5, 2012, and June 26, 2017, 461 patients were randomly assigned to either the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group (n=231) or the standard-of-care group (n=230). At a median follow-up of 46{$\cdot$}5 months (IQR 35{$\cdot$}4-61{$\cdot$}6), 3-year disease-free survival rates were 76\% (95\% CI 69-81) in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group and 69\% (62-74) in the standard-of-care group (stratified hazard ratio 0{$\cdot$}69, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}49-0{$\cdot$}97; p=0{$\cdot$}034). During neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the most common grade 3-4 adverse events were neutropenia (38 [17\%] of 225 patients) and diarrhoea (25 [11\%] of 226). During chemoradiotherapy, the most common grade 3-4 adverse event was lymphopenia (59 [28\%] of 212 in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group vs 67 [30\%] of 226 patients in the standard-of-care group). During adjuvant chemotherapy, the most common grade 3-4 adverse events were lymphopenia (18 [11\%] of 161 in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group vs 42 [27\%] of 155 in the standard-of-care group), neutropenia (nine [6\%] of 161 vs 28 [18\%] of 155), and peripheral sensory neuropathy (19 [12\%] of 162 vs 32 [21\%] of 155). Serious adverse events occurred in 63 (27\%) of 231 participants in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group and 50 (22\%) of 230 patients in the standard-of-care group (p=0{$\cdot$}167), during the whole treatment period. During adjuvant therapy, serious adverse events occurred in 18 (11\%) of 163 participants in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group and 36 (23\%) of 158 patients in the standard-of-care group (p=0{$\cdot$}0049). Treatment-related deaths occurred in one ({$<$}1\%) of 226 patients in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group (sudden death) and two (1\%) of 227 patients in the standard-of-care group (one sudden death and one myocardial infarction). INTERPRETATION: Intensification of chemotherapy using FOLFIRINOX before preoperative chemoradiotherapy significantly improved outcomes compared with preoperative chemoradiotherapy in patients with cT3 or cT4 M0 rectal cancer. The significantly improved disease-free survival in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group and the decreased neurotoxicity indicates that the perioperative approach is more efficient and better tolerated than adjuvant chemotherapy. Therefore, the PRODIGE 23 results might change clinical practice. FUNDING: Institut National du Cancer, Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer, and R\&D Unicancer.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Esophageal cancer (EC) is an aggressive malignancy with poor prognosis. Mortality and disease stage at diagnosis are important indicators of improvements in cancer prevention and control. We examined United States trends in esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) mortality and stage at diagnosis by race and ethnicity. METHODS: We used Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data to identify individuals with histologically confirmed EAC and ESCC between 1 January 1992 and 31 December 2016. For both EAC and ESCC, we calculated age-adjusted mortality and the proportion presenting at each stage by race/ethnicity, sex, and year. We then calculated the annual percent change (APC) in each indicator by race/ethnicity and examined changes over time. RESULTS: The study included 19,257 EAC cases and 15,162 ESCC cases. EAC mortality increased significantly overall and in non-Hispanic Whites from 1993 to 2012 and from 1993 to 2010, respectively. EAC mortality continued to rise among non-Hispanic Blacks (NHB) (APC\,=\,1.60, p\,=\,0.01). NHB experienced the fastest decline in ESCC mortality (APC\,=\,- 4.53, p\,{$<$}\,0.001) yet maintained the highest mortality at the end of the study period. Proportions of late stage disease increased overall by 18.5 and 24.5 percentage points for EAC and ESCC respectively; trends varied by race/ethnicity. CONCLUSION: We found notable differences in trends in EAC and ESCC mortality and stage at diagnosis by race/ethnicity. Stage migration resulting from improvements in diagnosis and treatment may partially explain recent trends in disease stage at diagnosis. Future efforts should identify factors driving current esophageal cancer disparities.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: The goal of treatment for Barrett's esophagus (BE) with dysplasia is complete eradication of intestinal metaplasia (CEIM). The long-term durability of CEIM has not been well characterized, so the frequency and duration of surveillance are unclear. We report results from a 5-year follow-up analysis of patients with BE and dysplasia treated by radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in the randomized controlled Ablation of Intestinal Metaplasia Containing Dysplasia (AIM) trial. METHODS: Participants for the AIM Dysplasia trial (18-80 years old) were recruited from 19 sites in the United States and had endoscopic evidence of non-nodular dysplastic BE {$\leq$}8~cm in length. Subjects (n~= 127) were randomly assigned (2:1 ratio) to receive either RFA (entire BE segment ablated circumferentially) or a sham endoscopic procedure; patients in the sham group were offered RFA treatment 1 year later, and all patients were followed for 5 years. We collected data on BE recurrence (defined as intestinal metaplasia in the tubular esophagus) and dysplastic BE recurrence among patients who achieved CEIM. We constructed Kaplan-Meier estimates and applied parametric survival analysis to examine proportions of patients without any recurrence and without dysplastic recurrence. RESULTS: Of 127 patients in the AIM Dysplasia trial, 119 received RFA and met inclusion criteria. Of those 119, 110 (92\%) achieved CEIM. Over 401 person-years of follow-up (mean, 3.6 years per patient; range, 0.2-5.8 years), 35 of 110 (32\%) patients had recurrence of BE or dysplasia, and 19 (17\%) had dysplasia recurrence. The incidence rate of BE recurrence was 10.8 per 100 person-years overall (95\% CI, 7.8-15.0); 8.3 per 100 person-years among patients with baseline low-grade dysplasia (95\% CI, 4.9-14.0), and 13.5 per 100 person-years among patients with baseline high-grade dysplasia (95\% CI 8.8-20.7). The incidence rate of dysplasia recurrence was 5.2 per 100 person-years overall (95\% CI 3.3-8.2); 3.3 per 100 person-years among patients with baseline low-grade dysplasia (95\% CI 1.5-7.2), and 7.3 per 100 person-years among patients with baseline high-grade dysplasia (95\%~CI 4.2-12.5). Neither BE nor dysplasia recurred at a constant rate. There was a greater probability of recurrence in the first year following CEIM than in the following 4 years combined. CONCLUSIONS: In this analysis of prospective cohort data from the AIM Dysplasia trial, we found BE to recur after CEIM by RFA in almost one third of patients with baseline dysplastic disease; most recurrences occurred during the first year after CEIM. However, patients who achieved CEIM and remained BE free at 1 year after RFA had a low risk of BE recurrence. Studies are needed to determine when surveillance can be decreased or discontinued; our study did not identify any BE or dysplasia recurrence after 4 years of surveillance.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients often receive induction therapy based on endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-identified nodal spread (N1) or deep tumor invasion (T3), although controversy exists regarding the role of induction therapy for early stage disease. We aim to evaluate the reliability of EUS in identifying early stage disease and the subsequent impact on treatment and outcomes. METHODS: We retrospectively studied 149 patients who underwent EUS and esophagectomy for adenocarcinoma between January 2000 and December 2008. Computed tomography (CT) was performed in all patients, whereas positron emission tomography (PET) was performed in 91\%. Clinical stage (c), pathologic stage (p), operative mortality, and survival were recorded. RESULTS: Unanticipated pathologic nodal disease was similar in patients with cT1N0 and cT2N0 tumors (6/25 [24\%] versus 7/18 [38.8\%]; p=0.6). Among the 18 cases of cT2N0 disease, 9 (50\%) were pathologically staged as T1N0, 8 (44\%) were upstaged to pT3N0-1, and 1 (6\%) was pT2N0. One case of cT1N0 tumor (4\%) was upstaged to pT3N0. Among patients with cT1-2N0 tumors, 5-year disease-free survival for the group that was appropriately staged was 89.8\% versus 39.9\% for the group that had a higher pathologic stage than their clinical stage (ie, {$>$}T2N0) (p{$<$}0.001). Operative mortality for patients with cT1-2N0 tumors was 0/43 (0\%), which was no different from that in the higher clinical stage groups with (1/37, 2.7\%) or without (2/68, 2.9\%) induction therapy (p=0.5). Multivariate analysis identified marked/intense uptake on staging PET (odds ratio, 5.76, 95\%; confidence interval, 1.25 to 26.52; p=0.021) to be a factor predictive of upstaging of cT1-2N0 tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Current staging techniques are inadequate for predicting T1-2N0 disease in esophageal adenocarcinoma. Survival is excellent with operation alone in patients with tumors appropriately staged as T1-2N0, although patients with tumors upstaged to greater than T2N0 have significantly worse survival. Other preoperative factors such as PET uptake may help select patients with cT1-2N0 tumors that will be upstaged at resection.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Clinical staging of esophageal cancer has improved with positron-emission tomography/computed tomography and endoscopic ultrasound imaging. Despite such progress, small single-center studies have questioned the reliability of clinical staging of T2 N0 esophageal cancer. This study broadly examines the adequacy of clinical staging of T2 N0 disease using The Society of Thoracic Surgeons database. METHODS: We retrospectively studied 810 clinical stage T2 N0 patients from 2002 to 2011, with 58 excluded because of incomplete pathologic staging data. Clinical stage, pathologic stage, and preoperative characteristics were recorded. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with upstaging at the time of surgical intervention. RESULTS: Among 752 clinical stage T2 N0 patients, 270 (35.9\%) received induction therapy before the operation. Of 482 patients who went directly to surgical intervention, 132 (27.4\%) were confirmed as pathologic T2 N0, 125 (25.9\%) were downstaged (ie, T0-1 N0), and 225 (46.7\%) were upstaged at the operation (T3-4 N0 or Tany N1-3). Exclusive tumor upstaging (ie, pathologic T3-4 N0) accounted for 41 patients (18.2\%), whereas exclusive nodal upstaging (ie, pathological T1-2 N1-3) accounted for 100 (44.5\%). Combined tumor and nodal upstaging (ie, pathological T3-4 N1-3) accounted for 84 patients (37.3\%). Among patients who received induction therapy, 103 (38.1\%) were upstaged vs 225 (46.7\%) without induction therapy (p = 0.026). Comparing the induction therapy group and the primary surgical group, postoperative 30-day mortality (3.7\% vs 3.7\%, p {$>$} 0.99) and morbidity (46.3\% vs 45\%, p = 0.76) were similar. CONCLUSIONS: Despite advances in staging techniques, clinical staging of T2 N0 esophageal cancer remains unreliable. Recognizing T2 N0 as a threshold for induction therapy in esophageal cancer, many surgeons have opted to treat T2 N0 disease with induction therapy, even though one-quarter of these patients will be pathologic T1 N0. Although this study demonstrated similar perioperative morbidity and mortality with and without induction therapy, further study is needed to examine the effect of upstaging on long-term survival.},

We retrospectively analyzed dose delays/reduction, relative dose intensity (RDI), and the association between chemotherapy intensity and survival in advanced NSCLC. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included adults with advanced lung cancer who received first-line myelosuppressive platinum-based chemotherapy (January 2007-December 2010) in \textasciitilde\,230 US Oncology Network community practices. Dose delays {$\geq$}\,7~days, dose reductions {$\geq$}\,15\%, and RDI relative to standard regimens were described. Overall survival (OS) was measured using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard (PH) models. RESULTS: Among 3866 patients with advanced NSCLC, 32.4\% experienced dose delays {$\geq$}\,7~days, 50.1\% experienced dose reductions {$\geq$}\,15\%, and 40.4\% had RDI {$<$}\,85\%. Reduced RDI was also common regardless of baseline ECOG PS (ECOG PS {$\geq$}\,2, 56.2\%; ECOG PS 0, 33.6\%) and tumor subgroup (squamous cell carcinoma, 52.2\%; adenocarcinoma, 36.0\%). When stratified by chemotherapy intensity measures, significant OS differences were observed only for dose delays. Median (95\% CI) OS was 1.02~years (0.96-1.12) for dose delays {$\geq$}\,7~days and 0.71~years (0.66-0.77) for dose delays {$<$}\,7~days. In multivariable Cox PH analysis, dose delays {$\geq$}\,7~days (HR\,=\,0.71; 95\% CI\,=\,0.63-0.80) and RDI {$\geq$}\,85\% (HR\,=\,1.18; 95\% CI\,=\,1.05-1.32) were significantly associated with decreased mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Dose delays, dose reductions, and reduced RDI were common, and dose delays {$\geq$}\,7~days and high RDI were significantly associated with decreased mortality. These results can help identify potential risk factors and characterize the effect of chemotherapy dose modification strategies on mortality.},

The comparative efficacy and safety of endoluminal stenting versus emergency surgery as initial treatment for such patients is uncertain.Patients with left-sided colonic obstruction and radiological features of carcinoma were randomized to endoluminal stenting using a combined endoscopic/fluoroscopic technique followed by elective surgery 1\textendash 4 weeks later, or surgical decompression with or without tumour resection. Treatment allocation was via a central randomization service using a minimization procedure stratified by curative intent, primary tumour site, and severity score (Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation). Co-primary outcome measures were duration of hospital stay and 30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes were stoma formation, stenting completion and complication rates, perioperative morbidity, 6-month survival, 3-year recurrence, resource use, adherence to chemotherapy, and quality of life. Analyses were undertaken by intention to treat.Between 23 April 2009 and 22 December 2014, 245 patients from 39 hospitals were randomized. Stenting was attempted in 119 of 123 allocated patients (96.7 per cent), achieving relief of obstruction in 98 of 119 (82.4 per cent). For the 89 per cent treated with curative intent, there were no significant differences in 30-day postoperative mortality (3.6 per cent (4 of 110) versus 5.6 per cent (6 of 107); P = 0.48), or duration of hospital stay (median 19 (i.q.r. 11\textendash 34) versus 18 (10\textendash 28) days; P = 0.94) between stenting followed by delayed elective surgery and emergency surgery. Among patients undergoing potentially curative treatment, stoma formation occurred less frequently in those allocated to stenting than those allocated to immediate surgery (47 of 99 (47.5 per cent) versus 72 of 106 (67.9 per cent); P = 0.003). There were no significant differences in perioperative morbidity, critical care use, quality of life, 3-year recurrence or mortality between treatment groups.Stenting as a bridge to surgery reduces stoma formation without detrimental effects.

Our objectives were to compare the survival and safety of ECOG PS 3/4 patients who were administered chemotherapy with those who received BSC only. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed all consecutive mCRC patients who started first-line chemotherapy at our institution in a 4-year period. A multivariable Cox regression model was used to adjust for prognostic factors and logistic regression, to identify predictive factors of Grade 3/4 toxicity. RESULTS: From June 2008 to June 2012, 240 consecutive patients were included: 100 (41.7\%) had an ECOG PS of 0/1, 75 (31.3\%) ECOG PS of 2, and 65 (27\%) ECOG PS of 3/4. Median survival for patients treated with chemotherapy was 18.4 months for patients with ECOG PS of 0/1, 10.8 months for those with ECOG PS of 2, and 6.8 months for patients with ECOG PS of 3/4. Among those with ECOG PS of 3/4, chemotherapy use led to a nonsignificant survival gain (median, 6.8 vs. 2.3 months for BSC; P = .13). Factors significantly associated with worse survival in an adjusted analysis were right-sided tumors (hazard ratio [HR], 2.97; P = .005) and ECOG PS status (ECOG PS 2 vs. 0/1; HR, 1.67; P = .025, and ECOG PS 3/4 vs. 0/1; HR, 2.67; P {$<$} .0001). The rate of Grade {$\geq$} 3 toxicities during the first cycle did not differ significantly across ECOG groups; likely because 40\% of ECOG PS 3/4 patients received upfront dose-reduced therapy. The rates of treatment-related hospitalization were similar across all ECOG groups. All deaths were disease-associated. CONCLUSION: Our retrospective study suggests that chemotherapy might benefit selected mCRC patients with poor PS. With up-front dose reduction and close monitoring for toxicity, the risk of serious adverse events is minimized.},

We assessed whether the addition of a perioperative regimen of ECF to surgery improves outcomes among patients with potentially curable gastric cancer. METHODS: We randomly assigned patients with resectable adenocarcinoma of the stomach, esophagogastric junction, or lower esophagus to either perioperative chemotherapy and surgery (250 patients) or surgery alone (253 patients). Chemotherapy consisted of three preoperative and three postoperative cycles of intravenous epirubicin (50 mg per square meter of body-surface area) and cisplatin (60 mg per square meter) on day 1, and a continuous intravenous infusion of fluorouracil (200 mg per square meter per day) for 21 days. The primary end point was overall survival. RESULTS: ECF-related adverse effects were similar to those previously reported among patients with advanced gastric cancer. Rates of postoperative complications were similar in the perioperative-chemotherapy group and the surgery group (46 percent and 45 percent, respectively), as were the numbers of deaths within 30 days after surgery. The resected tumors were significantly smaller and less advanced in the perioperative-chemotherapy group. With a median follow-up of four years, 149 patients in the perioperative-chemotherapy group and 170 in the surgery group had died. As compared with the surgery group, the perioperative-chemotherapy group had a higher likelihood of overall survival (hazard ratio for death, 0.75; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.60 to 0.93; P=0.009; five-year survival rate, 36 percent vs. 23 percent) and of progression-free survival (hazard ratio for progression, 0.66; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.53 to 0.81; P{$<$}0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with operable gastric or lower esophageal adenocarcinomas, a perioperative regimen of ECF decreased tumor size and stage and significantly improved progression-free and overall survival.

  abstract = {Background Hip fractures occur frequently in the elderly population over the age of 60 years following low-energy domestic falls. The postoperative mortality after hip fracture surgery depends on numerous factors like comorbidities, pre-fall ambulatory status, nutritional status, cognition, and overall physical health. In this context, the physiological age and reserve play~a vital role in mortality after hip fracture surgeries. This physiological reserve is measured in terms of "frailty."~There are many frailty indices that assess the physiological reserves of an elderly patient. The modified frailty index (MFI) is one of the validated indexes predicting postoperative complications and mortality. So we concluded there is a need to assess the patients with MFI preoperatively, based on which mortality and postoperative complications could be predicted in our patients. Materials and methods We included 100 patients aged more than 60 years with intertrochanteric and neck of the femur fractures, who were managed surgically. We followed the patients for one year and observed the immediate and late complications and mortality at the end of one year. To reduce bias, patients with pathological fractures, revision surgeries, contralateral fractures, high-energy trauma, younger than 60 years of age, and previous proximal femur fracture surgery on the side of injury were excluded from the study. Results The primary objective was to study the correlation between the MFI with one-year mortality. We observe that the MFI score had a significant effect on mortality at one year (p-value = 0.0316). With a unit increase in the MFI score, the odds of death increase by a factor of 1.52. Conclusion There is a strong correlation between MFI with one-year mortality and postoperative complications after hip fracture surgeries in the elderly. This MFI can be used as a preoperative predictive model to predict the mortality and postoperative complications after hip fractures in the elderly. It will also help patients and their caretakers in decision-making and elucidating surgery choices.},

Background There are limited data on the use of body composition as a frailty measure in TAVR patients and no studies have determined if this measure predicts LOS. Methods We studied 104 consecutive patients who underwent TAVR at Tallahassee Memorial Hospital from 2012 to 2016. Patient demographics, standard frailty measures (hand grip, albumin, and 5-m walk test), clinical comorbidities, echocardiographic data, and Valve Academic Research Consortium II major complications were recorded prospectively. Skeletal muscle index (SMI) [skeletal muscle mass cross-sectional area at L3/height2] was measured from CT images using Slice-O-Matic software (Tomovision, Montreal, Quebec, Canada). Clinical outcomes were assessed and multivariate methods used to determine predictors of LOS. Results Sarcopenia was prevalent in men (83\%) and women (56\%). Patients who suffered from a major complication had significantly longer length of stay (13 vs 4.6 days, P b .0001). Skeletal muscle index correlated with age, sex, body mass index, handgrip strength, and previous coronary artery bypass graft surgery, but not major complications. A multivariate model including all univariate predictors of LOS showed SMI, major complications, transapical access, atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary syndrome as independent predictors of LOS. For every 14-cm2/m2 increase in SMI, there was a 1-day reduction in LOS. None of the standard measures of frailty predicted LOS. Conclusions Skeletal muscle index, a measure of sarcopenia readily determined from pre-TAVR CT scans, independently predicts TAVR LOS better than standard frailty testing. Further evaluation of SMI as a frailty measure after TAVR and other cardiovascular procedures is warranted. (Am Heart J 2016;182:21-7.)},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: For patients with cancer who are older than 65 years, the 2018 ASCO Guideline recommends geriatric assessment (GA) be performed. However, there are limited data on providers' practices using GA. Therefore, ASCO's Geriatric Oncology Task Force conducted a survey of providers to assess practice patterns and barriers to GA. METHODS: Cancer providers treating adult patients including those {$\geq$} 65 years completed an online survey. Questions included those asking about awareness of ASCO's Geriatric Oncology Guideline (2018), use of validated GA tools, and perceived barriers to using GA. Descriptive statistics and statistical comparisons between those aware of the Guideline and those who were not were conducted. Statistical significance was set at P {$<$} .05. RESULTS: Participants (N = 1,277) responded between April 5 and June 5, 2019. Approximately half (53\%) reported awareness of the Guideline. The most frequently used GA tools, among those aware of the Guideline and those who were not, assessed functional status (69\% v 50\%; P {$<$} .001) and falls (62\% v 45\%; P {$<$} .001). Remaining tools were used {$<$} 50\% of the time, including tools assessing weight loss, comorbidities, cognition, life expectancy, chemotherapy toxicity, mood, and noncancer mortality risk. GA use was two to four times higher among those who are aware of the Guideline. The most frequent barriers for those who reported being Guideline aware were lack of resources, specifically time (81.7\%) and staff (77.0\%). In comparison, those who were unaware of the Guideline most often reported the following barriers: lack of knowledge or training (78.4\%), lack of awareness about tools (75.2\%), and uncertainty about use of tools (75.0\%). CONCLUSION: Among providers caring for older adults, 52\% were aware of the ASCO Guideline. Some domains were assessed frequently (eg, function, falls), whereas other domains were assessed rarely (eg, mood, cognition). Guideline awareness was associated with two to four times increased use of GA and differing perceived barriers. Interventions facilitating Guideline-consistent implementation will require various strategies to change behavior.},

  abstract = {Advancements in image-based technologies and body composition research over the past decade has led to increased understanding of the importance of muscle abnormalities, such as low muscle mass (sarcopenia), and more recently low muscle attenuation (MA), as important prognostic indicators of unfavourable outcomes in patients with cancer. Muscle abnormalities can be highly prevalent in patients with cancer (ranging between 10 and 90 \%), depending on the cohort under investigation and diagnostic criteria used. Importantly, both low muscle mass and low MA have been associated with poorer tolerance to chemotherapy, increased risk of post-operative infectious and non-infectious complications, increased length of hospital stay and poorer survival in patients with cancer. Studies have shown that systemic antineoplastic treatment can exacerbate losses in muscle mass and MA, with reported loss of skeletal muscle between 3 and 5 \% per 100 d, which are increased exponentially with progressive disease and proximity to death. At present, no effective medical intervention to improve muscle mass and MA exists. Most research to date has focused on treating muscle depletion as part of the cachexia syndrome using nutritional, exercise and pharmacological interventions; however, these single-agent therapies have not provided promising results. Rehabilitation care to modify body composition, either increasing muscle mass and/or MA should be conducted, and its respective impact on oncology outcomes explored. Although the optimal timing and treatment strategy for preventing or delaying the development of muscle abnormalities are yet to be determined, multimodal interventions initiated early in the disease trajectory appear to hold the most promise.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several studies have indicated that a restrictive erythrocyte transfusion strategy is as safe as a liberal one in critically ill patients, but there is no clear evidence to support the superiority of any perioperative transfusion strategy in patients with cancer. METHODS: In a randomized, controlled, parallel-group, double-blind (patients and outcome assessors) superiority trial in the intensive care unit of a tertiary oncology hospital, the authors evaluated whether a restrictive strategy of erythrocyte transfusion (transfusion when hemoglobin concentration {$<$}7 g/dl) was superior to a liberal one (transfusion when hemoglobin concentration {$<$}9 g/dl) for reducing mortality and severe clinical complications among patients having major cancer surgery. All adult patients with cancer having major abdominal surgery who required postoperative intensive care were included and randomly allocated to treatment with the liberal or the restrictive erythrocyte transfusion strategy. The primary outcome was a composite endpoint of mortality and morbidity. RESULTS: A total of 198 patients were included as follows: 101 in the restrictive group and 97 in the liberal group. The primary composite endpoint occurred in 19.6\% (95\% CI, 12.9 to 28.6\%) of patients in the liberal-strategy group and in 35.6\% (27.0 to 45.4\%) of patients in the restrictive-strategy group (P = 0.012). Compared with the restrictive strategy, the liberal transfusion strategy was associated with an absolute risk reduction for the composite outcome of 16\% (3.8 to 28.2\%) and a number needed to treat of 6.2 (3.5 to 26.5). CONCLUSION: A liberal erythrocyte transfusion strategy with a hemoglobin trigger of 9 g/dl was associated with fewer major postoperative complications in patients having major cancer surgery compared with a restrictive strategy.},

We aimed to update the International Society of Geriatric Oncology (SIOG) 2005 recommendations on the use of screening tools. MATERIALS AND METHODS: SIOG composed a task group to review, interpret and discuss evidence on the use of screening tools in older cancer patients. A systematic review was carried out and discussed by an expert panel, leading to a consensus statement on their use. RESULTS: Forty-four studies reporting on the use of 17 different screening tools in older cancer patients were identified. The tools most studied in older cancer patients are G8, Flemish version of the Triage Risk Screening Tool (fTRST) and Vulnerable Elders Survey-13 (VES-13). Across all studies, the highest sensitivity was observed for: G8, fTRST, Oncogeriatric screen, Study of Osteoporotic Fractures, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group-Performance Status, Senior Adult Oncology Program (SAOP) 2 screening and Gerhematolim. In 11 direct comparisons for detecting problems on a full GA, the G8 was more or equally sensitive than other instruments in all six comparisons, whereas results were mixed for the VES-13 in seven comparisons. In addition, different tools have demonstrated associations with outcome measures, including G8 and VES-13. CONCLUSIONS: Screening tools do not replace GA but are recommended in a busy practice in order to identify those patients in need of full GA. If abnormal, screening should be followed by GA and guided multidisciplinary interventions. Several tools are available with different performance for various parameters (including sensitivity for addressing the need for further GA). Further research should focus on the ability of screening tools to build clinical pathways and to predict different outcome parameters.},

  abstract = {AIMS: Selection of patients for treatment of oesophagogastric cancers rests on accurate staging. Laparoscopy has become a safe and effective staging tool in upper gastrointestinal cancers because of its ability to detect small peritoneal and liver metastases missed by imaging techniques. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of staging laparoscopy (SL) in determining resectability of oesophagogastric cancers. METHODS: A review of 511 patients with oesophagogastric cancers referred to our centre during a 7-year period was performed. Four hundred and sixteen of them assessed to have resectable tumours after preoperative staging with CT and/or ultrasound underwent SL. The main outcome measure was the number of patients in whom laparoscopy changed treatment decision. RESULTS: Staging laparoscopy changed treatment decision in 84 cases (20.2\%): locally advanced disease in 17, extensive lymph node disease in four and distant metastases (liver and peritoneum) in 63 cases. The sensitivity of laparoscopy for resectability was 88\%. Eighty-one percent of patients who had combined CT scan and EUS were resectable at surgery compared with 65\% of those who had CT scan alone (statistically significant with P-value{$<$}0.05). Of those patients deemed resectable by SL 8.1\% were found to be unresectable at laparotomy, 16 with locally advanced disease and 11 with metastases. CONCLUSION: Staging laparoscopy avoided unnecessary laparotomy in 20.2\% of our patients and was most useful in adenocarcinoma, distal oesophageal, GOJ and gastric cancers and probably not necessary in lesions of the upper two-third of the oesophagus.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To clarify national clinical and economic laparoscopic colectomy outcomes, we conducted a study of patients who underwent colectomy by laparoscopic or open approaches. BACKGROUND: Laparoscopy is becoming the preferred approach for colectomy in benign and malignant diseases. Although it is associated with significant clinical benefits, economic outcomes have varied. METHODS: We analyzed cohorts of patient-level data from Premier Inc.'s Perspective Rx Comparative Database, which collects data from more than 500 hospitals throughout the United States. By reviewing hospital charge data, patients who underwent elective colectomies from July 1, 2004, through June 30, 2006, were identified using International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification procedure codes. The colectomy had to be listed as the primary or secondary procedure of the hospitalization. Primary outcomes included transfusion rates, in-hospital complications, readmissions within 30 days, reoperations, length of stay, total hospitalization costs, and discharge dispositions and services. RESULTS: We identified 32,733 patients who had elective colectomies throughout 402 hospitals; 11,044 (33.7\%) were laparoscopic and 21,689 (66.3\%) were open colectomies. The mean age was 64.2 +/- 13.9 years and 53.8\% were women. Laparoscopic colectomy patients had a longer mean operative time (195 +/- 76 vs. 178 +/- 80 minutes; P {$<$} 0.0001) and higher total hospital costs (\$8076 vs. \$7678; P = 0.0002). Laparoscopic patients had shorter mean length of stay (7.0 vs. 8.1; P {$<$} 0.0001) and fewer mean intensive care unit days (0.7 +/- 3.8 vs. 1.3 +/- 5.2 days; P {$<$} 0.0001). The laparoscopic cohort also had lower rates of transfusions (odds ratio [OR] = 0.68; P {$<$} 0.0001), in-hospital complications (OR = 0.89; P {$<$} 0.0001), and readmissions within 30 days (OR = 0.89; P = 0.0051), although reoperation rates were slightly, but significantly increased (OR = 1.78; P = 0.002). Laparoscopic colectomy patients were more likely to be discharged home without nursing care (OR = 0.70; P {$<$} 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Evaluation of a national administrative data set showed that patients who underwent laparoscopic colectomy had shorter intensive care unit and total hospital stays, fewer complications, lower mortality, fewer readmissions, and less use of skilled nursing facilities after discharge. There was a small but significant increase in reoperation rates and in-hospital costs with laparoscopic colectomy. Improved application of enhanced recovery programs and operative efficiencies may further improve resource utilization associated with laparoscopic colectomy.},

  abstract = {The impact of preoperative sarcopenia on long-term survival of esophageal cancer patients after esophagectomy remains unclear. We conducted an updated meta-analysis focusing on current topic comprehensively. We systematically searched relevant studies investigating the impact of preoperative sarcopenia on survival of patients with surgically treated esophageal cancer in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science up to July 20, 2018. Data of 3-year and 5-year overall survival (OS) rates as well as hazard ratio (HR) of OS and disease-free survival (DFS) were collected for analysis by using the STATA 12.0 package. Finally, a total of 11 cohort studies consisting of 1520 patients (795 sarcopenic patients and 725 nonsarcopenic patients) were included for analysis. Our meta-analysis showed that patients with sarcopenia had a significantly lower 3-year (51.6\% vs. 65.4\%, P~{$<~$}0.001) and 5-year OS rate (41.2\% vs. 52.2\%, P~=~0.018) than those without sarcopenia. Sarcopenia was found to be an independent predictor of poor OS (HR~=~1.58; 95\% confidence interval (CI)~=~[1.35, 1.85]; P~{$<~$}0.001) and DFS (HR~=~1.46; 95\% CI~=~[1.12, 1.90]; P~=~0.005) in esophageal cancer patients after esophagectomy. No obvious heterogeneities or publication bias were observed during analysis. Therefore, patients with sarcopenia had a significantly worse prognosis than those without after surgical resection of esophageal cancer. Preoperative sarcopenia is an independent unfavorable prognostic factor for esophageal cancer patients after esophagectomy. However, high-quality studies with appropriate adjustments for confounding factors are needed to confirm our conclusions.},

  abstract = {Measurements of skeletal muscle cross-sectional area (SMA) at the level of the third lumbar (L3) vertebra derived from clinical computed tomography (CT) scans are commonly used in assessments of sarcopenia, the loss of skeletal muscle mass and function associated with aging. As SMA is correlated with height and Body Mass Index (BMI), body size adjustment is necessary to fairly assess sarcopenic low muscle mass in individuals of different height and BMI. The skeletal muscle index, a widely used measure, adjusts for height as [Formula: see text] but uses no BMI adjustment. There is no agreed upon standard for body size adjustment. We extracted L3 SMA using non-contrast-enhanced CT scans from healthy adults, split into 'Under-40' and 'Over-40' cohorts. Sex-specific allometric analysis showed that height to the power of one was the optimal integer coefficient for height adjusted SMA in both males and females. We computed two height-adjusted measures [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text], comparing their Pearson correlations versus age, height, weight, and BMI separately by sex and cohort. Finally, in the 'Under-40' cohort, we used linear regression to convert each height-adjusted measure into a z-score ([Formula: see text], [Formula: see text]) adjusted for BMI. [Formula: see text] was less correlated with height in both males and females ([Formula: see text], [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text]) than [Formula: see text] ([Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text]). [Formula: see text] was uncorrelated with BMI and weight, and minimally correlated with height in males and females ([Formula: see text], [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text]). The final [Formula: see text] equation was: [Formula: see text], where [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], and sex = 1 if male, 0 if female. We propose [Formula: see text] for optimal height adjustment and the [Formula: see text] score for optimal height and BMI adjustment. By minimizing correlations with height and BMI, the [Formula: see text] score produces unbiased assessments of relative L3 skeletal muscle area across the full range of body sizes.},

We aimed to evaluate the overall survival, factors associated with early mortality, and adoption of additional procedures in hospitalized patients with advanced cancer and poor ECOG-PS treated with PC. Methods: We analyzed a retrospective cohort of patients with advanced cancer treated with PC during hospitalization at an academic cancer center in Brazil from 2014 to 2016. Eligibility criteria included: ECOG-PS 3\textendash 4 and start of first-line PC; or ECOG-PS {$\geq$} 2 and start of second or subsequent lines. Primary endpoint was 30-day survival from start of PC. Kaplan-Meier method was used for survival estimates and Cox regression for factors associated with 30-day mortality. Results: Two hundred twenty-eight patients were eligible. 21.9, 66.7 and 11.4\% of patients had ECOG-PS 2, 3 and 4, respectively. 49.6\% had gastrointestinal tumors. Median follow-up was 49 days (range 1\textendash 507). 98.2\% of patients had died, 32\% during the index hospitalization. The 30-day and 60-day survival rates were 55.7 and 38.5\%, respectively. 30\% of patients were admitted to the intensive care unit. In a multivariable analysis, ECOG-PS 3/4 (HR 2.01; P = 0.016), hypercalcemia (HR 2.19; P = 0.005), and elevated bilirubin (HR 3.17; P {$<$} 0.001) were significantly associated with 30-day mortality. Conclusions: Patients with advanced cancer and poor ECOG-PS had short survival after treatment with inpatient PC. Inpatient PC was associated with aggressive end-of-life care. Prognostic markers such as ECOG-PS, hypercalcemia and elevated bilirubin can contribute to the decision-making process for these patients.},

  abstract = {Administrative databases are increasingly used for studying outcomes of medical care. Valid inferences from such data require the ability to account for disease severity and comorbid conditions. We adapted a clinical comorbidity index, designed for use with medical records, for research relying on International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis and procedure codes. The association of this adapted index with health outcomes and resource use was then examined with a sample of Medicare beneficiaries who underwent lumbar spine surgery in 1985 (n = 27,111). The index was associated in the expected direction with postoperative complications, mortality, blood transfusion, discharge to nursing home, length of hospital stay, and hospital charges. These associations were observed whether the index incorporated data from multiple hospitalizations over a year's time, or just from the index surgical admission. They also persisted after controlling for patient age. We conclude that the adapted comorbidity index will be useful in studies of disease outcome and resource use employing administrative databases.},

  abstract = {Background Cancer cachexia and skeletal muscle wasting are related to poor survival. In this study, quantitative body composition measurements using computed tomography (CT) were investigated in relation to survival, post-operative complications, and surgical site infections in surgical patients with cancer of the head of the pancreas. Methods A prospective cohort of 199 patients with cancer of the head of the pancreas was analysed by CT imaging at the L3 level to determine (i) muscle radiation attenuation (average Hounsfield units of total L3 skeletal muscle); (ii) visceral adipose tissue area; (iii) subcutaneous adipose tissue area; (iv) intermuscular adipose tissue area; and (v) skeletal muscle area. Sexspecific cut-offs were determined at the lower tertile for muscle radiation attenuation and skeletal muscle area and the higher tertile for adipose tissues. These variables of body composition were related to overall survival, severe post-operative complications (Dindo\textendash Clavien {$\geq$} 3), and surgical site infections (wounds inspected daily by an independent trial nurse) using Coxregression analysis and multivariable logistic regression analysis, respectively. Results Low muscle radiation attenuation was associated with shorter survival in comparison with moderate and high muscle radiation attenuation [median survival 10.8 (95\% CI: 8.8\textendash 12.8) vs. 17.4 (95\% CI: 14.7\textendash 20.1), and 18.5 (95\% CI: 9.2\textendash 27.8) months, respectively; P {$<$} 0.008]. Patient subgroups with high muscle radiation attenuation combined with either low visceral adipose tissue or age {$<$}70 years had longer survival than other subgroups (P = 0.011 and P = 0.001, respectively). Muscle radiation attenuation was inversely correlated with intermuscular adipose tissue (rp = \`A0.697, P {$<$} 0.001). High visceral adipose tissue was associated with an increased surgical site infection rate, OR: 2.4 (95\% CI: 1.1\textendash 5.3; P = 0.027). Conclusions Low muscle radiation attenuation was associated with reduced survival, and high visceral adiposity was associated with an increase in surgical site infections. The strong correlation between muscle radiation attenuation and intermuscular adipose tissue suggests the presence of ectopic fat in muscle, warranting further investigation. CT image analysis could be implemented in pre-operative risk assessment to assist in treatment decision-making.},

  abstract = {Background Palliative systemic treatment in patients with advanced or metastatic esophagogastric cancer may result in improved overall survival and quality of life but can also lead to considerable toxicity. In various cancer types, severe muscle mass depletion (sarcopenia) and poor muscle strength are associated with decreased survival and increased chemotherapy-related toxicity. The aim of this study is to determine the impact of body composition on survival and chemotherapy toxicity in esophagogastric cancer patients treated with first-line palliative chemotherapy. Methods A total of 88 patients with advanced esophagogastric cancer treated with standard first-line palliative systemic therapy consisting of capecitabine and oxaliplatin (CapOx) between January 2010 and February 2017 were included. Skeletal muscle index (SMI), reflecting muscle mass, and skeletal muscle density (SMD), associated with muscle strength, were measured using pre-treatment of all patients and evaluation computed tomography scans after three treatment cycles of 65 patients and were used to determine sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity (i.e. sarcopenia and body mass index {$>$}25 kg/m2). The associations between body composition (SMI, SMD, sarcopenia, and sarcopenic obesity) and survival and toxicity were assessed using univariable and multivariable Cox and logistic regression analyses, respectively. Results Of 88 patients, 75\% was male, and median age was 63 (interquartile range 56\textendash 69) years. The majority of patients had an adenocarcinoma (83\%). Before start of treatment, 49\% of the patients were sarcopenic, and 20\% had sarcopenic obesity. Low SMD was observed in 50\% of patients. During three cycles CapOx, SMI significantly decreased, with a median decrease of 4\% (interquartile range -8.6\textendash -0.4). Median progression-free and overall survival were 6.9 and 10.1 months. SMI, SMD, sarcopenia, and sarcopenic obesity (both pre-treatment and after three cycles) were neither associated with progression-free nor overall survival. Pre-treatment SMD was independently associated with grade 3\textendash 4 toxicity (odds ratio 0.94; 95\% confidence interval 0.89\textendash 1.00) and sarcopenic obesity with grade 2\textendash 4 neuropathy (odds ratio 3.82; 95\% confidence interval 1.20\textendash 12.18). Conclusions Sarcopenia was not associated with survival or treatment-related toxicity in advanced esophagogastric cancer patients treated with CapOx. Pre-treatment sarcopenic obesity was independently associated with the occurrence of grade 2\textendash 4 neurotoxicity and skeletal muscle density with grade 3\textendash 4 toxicity.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The most recent systematic review and meta-analysis comparing the analgesic efficacy and side effects of paravertebral and epidural blockade for thoracotomy was published in 2006. Nine well-designed randomized trials with controversial results have been published since then. The present report constitutes an updated meta-analysis of this issue. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND: Thoracotomy is a major surgical procedure and is associated with severe postoperative pain. Epidural analgesia is the gold standard for post-thoracotomy pain management, but has its limitations and contraindications, and paravertebral blockade is increasingly popular. However, it has not been decided whether the analgesic effect of the two methods is comparable, or whether paravertebral blockade leads to a lower incidence of adverse side effects after thoracotomy. METHODS: Two reviewers independently searched the databases PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library (last performed on 1 February, 2013) for reports of studies comparing post-thoracotomy epidural analgesia and paravertebral blockade. The same individuals independently extracted data from the appropriate studies. RESULT: Eighteen trials involving 777 patients were included in the current analysis. There was no significant difference in pain scores between paravertebral blockade and epidural analgesia at 4-8, 24, 48 hours, and the rates of pulmonary complications and morphine usage during the first 24 hours were also similar. However, paravertebral blockade was better than epidural analgesia in reducing the incidence of urinary retention (p{$<$}0.0001), nausea and vomiting (p{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.01), hypotension (p{$<$}0.00001), and rates of failed block were lower in the paravertebral blockade group (p{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis showed that PVB can provide comparable pain relief to traditional EPI, and may have a better side-effect profile for pain relief after thoracic surgery. Further high-powered randomized trials are to need to determine whether PVB truly offers any advantages over EPI.},

  abstract = {Malnutrition is common 1 year after esophageal cancer surgery. However, the prognostic impact of this malnutrition on long-term outcome has been poorly reported. This study aims at determining the potential effect on disease-free survival (DFS) of weight loss observed at 1 year in disease-free survivors after curative esophageal resection. From a prospective single-institution database, 304 patients having undergone a transthoracic esophagectomy with two-field lymphadenectomy and gastric reconstruction between 1996 to 2008 were identified. Patients who died during the postoperative course (n= 24), patients who died within the first postoperative year (n= 12), patients who presented with an early recurrence within the first postoperative year (n= 20), and those who were lost to follow-up (n= 22) were excluded from the study, as well as those for whom the follow-up was shorter than 1 year (n= 21). The remaining 205 patients constituted a homogeneous group of 1-year disease-free survivors after full postoperative work-up and formed the material of the present study. Body weight (BW) values were collected before any treatment at the onset of symptoms (initial BW) and 1 year after esophagectomy. A 1-year weight loss (1-YWL) exceeding 10\% of the initial BW defined an important malnutrition. Impact of the 1-YWL{$\geq$} or \&lt;10\% of the initial BW on DFS was investigated. Logistic regression was performed to identify factors affecting DFS. The mean initial BW was 69.1 {$\pm$} 12{$\quad$}kg, corresponding to a mean body mass index (BMI) of 23.8 {$\pm$} 3{$\quad$}kg/m2. Preoperatively, 32 (15\%) patients were in the underweight category (BMI \&lt; 20{$\quad$}kg/m2), 110 (54\%) were in normal (BMI = 20\textendash 24{$\quad$}kg/m2), and 63 (31\%) were in the overweight category (BMI {$\geq$} 25{$\quad$}kg/m2). Mean 1-year BW was 63.5 {$\pm$} 12{$\quad$}kg. 1-YWL was \&lt;10\% of the initial BW in 92 patients (45\%) and {$\geq$}10\% in 113 patients (55\%). Accordingly, 5-year DFS rates were 66\% (median: 80 months) and 48\% (median: 51 months), respectively (P= 0.005). On multivariate analysis, only three independent variables affected the DFS significantly: clinical N stage (cN) status (P= 0.007; odds ratio: 1.99, 1.2\textendash 3.3), incomplete resection (P= 0.008, OR: 3.6, 1.3\textendash 9.3), and 1-YWL {$\geq$} 10\% (P= 0.004, OR: 2.1: 1.2\textendash 3.4). 1-YWL of or exceeding 10\% of the initial BW in 1-year disease-free survivors has a negative prognostic impact on DFS after esophagectomy for cancer. This information offers another view on the objectives of the perioperative nutritional care of these patients. Special vigilance program on the nutritional status in post-esophagectomy patients should be the rule.},

We reviewed a retrospective cohort of 27 patients treated at a single institution between 1999 and 2011. Clinical staging was performed with computed tomography, positron emission tomography, and endoscopic ultrasound. Patients were separated into two groups: neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgery (NEOSURG) and surgery alone (SURG). There were 11 patients (41\%) in the NEOSURG group and 16 patients (59\%) in the SURG group. In the NEOSURG group, three of 11 patients (27\%) had a pathological complete response and eight (73\%) were partial or nonresponders after neoadjuvant therapy. In the SURG group, nine of 16 patients (56\%) were understaged, 6 (38\%) were overstaged, and 1 (6\%) was correctly staged. In the entire cohort, despite being clinically node negative, 14 of 27 patients (52\%) had node-positive disease (5/11 [45\%] in the NEOSURG group, and 9/16 [56\%] in the SURG group). Overall survival rate was not statistically significant between the two groups (P = 0.96). Many cT2N0 patients are clinically understaged and show no preoperative evidence of node-positive disease.

METHODS: All patients in the current study were treated with trimodality therapy for nonmetastatic esophageal cancer from 1995 to 2009. Locoregional failure included lymph node failure (NF), anastomotic failure, or both. Abdominal paraaortic failure (PAF) was defined as disease recurrence at or below the superior mesenteric artery. RESULTS: Among 155 patients, the primary tumor location was the upper/middle esophagus in 18\%, the lower esophagus in 32\%, and the gastroesophageal junction in 50\% (adenocarcinoma in 79\% and squamous cell carcinoma in 21\%) of patients. Staging methods included endoscopic ultrasound (73\%), computed tomography (46\%), and positron emission tomography/computed tomography (54\%). Approximately 40\% of patients had American Joint Committee on Cancer stage II disease and 60\% had stage III disease. The median follow-up was 1.3 years. The 2-year locoregional control, event-free survival, and overall survival rates were 86\%, 36\%, and 48\%, respectively. The 2-year NF rate was 14\%, the isolated NF rate was 3\%, and the anastomotic failure rate was 6\%. The 2-year PAF rate was 9\% and the isolated PAF rate was 5\%. PAF was found to be increased among patients with gastroesophageal junction tumors (12\% vs 6\%), especially for the subset with {$\geq$} 2 clinically involved lymph nodes at the time of diagnosis (19\% vs 4\%). CONCLUSIONS: Few patients experience isolated NF or PAF as their first disease recurrence. Therefore, it is unlikely that targeting additional regional lymph node basins with radiotherapy would significantly improve clinical outcomes.},

This study aimed to assess the value of routine retesting following neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Methods Patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy with subsequent oesophagogastric cancer surgery with pre- and post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy cardiopulmonary exercise data were identified from a prospectively maintained database. Measured cardiopulmonary exercise variables included AT and maximum oxygen uptake at peak exercise (VO2 peak). Anaerobic threshold values within 1 ml/kg/minute were considered static. Patients were grouped into AT ranges of less than 9 ml/kg/minute, 9-11 ml/kg/minute and greater than 11 ml/kg/minute. Outcome measures were unplanned intensive care stay, postoperative cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Results Between May 2008 and August 2017, 42 patients from 675 total resections were identified, with a mean age of 65 years (range 49-84 years). Mean pre-neoadjuvant chemotherapy AT was 11.07 ml/kg/minute (standard deviation, SD, 3.24 ml/kg/minute, range 4.6-19.3 ml/kg/minute) while post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy AT was 11.19 ml/kg/minute (SD 3.05 ml/kg/minute, range 5.2-18.1 ml/kg/minute). Mean pre-neoadjuvant chemotherapy VO2 peak was 17.13 ml/kg/minute, while post-chemotherapy this mean fell to 16.59 ml/kg/minute. Some 44.4\% of patients with a pre-chemotherapy AT less than 9 ml/kg/minute developed cardiorespiratory complications compared with 42.2\% of those whose AT was greater than 9 ml/kg/minute (P = 0.914); 63.6\% of patients in the post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy group with an AT less than 9 ml/kg/minute developed cardiorespiratory complications. There was no correlation between direction of change in AT and outcome. Conclusion In our patient population, neoadjuvant chemotherapy does not appear to result in a significant mean reduction in cardiorespiratory fitness. Routine pre- and post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy cardiopulmonary exercise testing is currently not indicated; however, larger studies are required to demonstrate this conclusively.},

The objective of this study was to use the electronic Veterans Affairs Frailty Index (VA-FI-10)-developed and validated to measure frailty in the national United States (US) VA Healthcare System-to estimate the prevalence and impact of frailty in older US veterans newly treated for multiple myeloma (MM) with contemporary therapies. We designed a retrospective cohort study of 4924 transplant-ineligible veterans aged {$\geq$} 65 years initiating MM therapy within VA from 2004 to 2017. Initial MM therapy was measured using inpatient and outpatient treatment codes from pharmacy data in the VA Corporate Data Warehouse. In total, 3477 veterans (70.6\%) were classified as frail (VA-FI-10 {$>$} 0.2), with 1510 (30.7\%) mildly frail (VA-FI-10 {$>$} 0.2-0.3), 1105 (22.4\%) moderately frail (VA-FI-10 {$>$} 0.3-0.4), and 862 (17.5\%) severely frail (VA-FI-10 {$>$} 0.4). Survival and time to hospitalization decreased with increasing VA-FI-10 severity (log-rank p-value {$<$} 0.001); the VA-FI-10 predicted mortality and hospitalizations independently of age, sociodemographic variables, and measures of disease risk. Varying data sources and assessment periods reclassified frailty severity for a substantial portion of veterans but did not substantially affect VA-FI-10's association with mortality. Our study supports use of the VA-FI-10 in future research involving older veterans with MM and provides insights into its potential use in identifying frailty in clinical practice.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Endoscopic eradication therapy is used to treat mucosal neoplasms in Barrett's esophagus, but cannot cure cancers that have metastasized to lymph nodes. The risk of such metastases has been proposed as a reason to consider esophagectomy rather than endoscopic therapy for esophageal mucosal neoplasia. The objective of our study was to determine the frequency of lymph-node metastases in patients with high-grade dysplasia (HGD) and intramucosal carcinoma in Barrett's esophagus. METHODS: We performed a systematic review using the PRISMA guidelines to identify studies that included patients who had esophagectomy for HGD or intramucosal carcinoma in Barrett's esophagus, and that reported final pathology results after examination of esophagectomy specimens. RESULTS: We identified 70 relevant reports that included 1,874 patients who had esophagectomy performed for HGD or intramucosal carcinoma in Barrett's esophagus. Lymph-node metastases were found in 26 patients (1.39 \% , 95 \% CI 0.86 \textendash{} 1.92). No metastases were found in the 524 patients who had a final pathology diagnosis of HGD, whereas 26 (1.93 \% , 95 \% CI 1.19 \textendash{} 2.66 \%) of the 1,350 patients with a final pathology diagnosis of intramucosal carcinoma had positive lymph nodes. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of unexpected lymph-node metastases for patients with mucosal neoplasms in Barrett's esophagus is in the range of 1 \textendash{} 2 \%. Esophagectomy has a mortality rate that often exceeds 2 \%, with substantial morbidity and no guarantee of curing metastatic disease. Therefore, the risk of lymph node metastases alone does not warrant the choice of esophagectomy over endoscopic therapy for HGD and intramucosal carcinoma in Barrett's esophagus.},

In many cases, changes in muscle mass, particularly abdominal muscle, indicate how well a patient is responding to treatment. Therefore, physicians use CT to monitor changes in muscle mass throughout the patient's course of treatment. In order to measure the muscle, radiologists must segment and review each CT slice manually, which is a time-consuming task. In this work, we present a fully convolutional neural network (CNN) for the segmentation of abdominal muscle on CT. We achieved a mean Dice similarity coefficient of 0.92, a mean precision of 0.93, and a mean recall of 0.91 in an independent test set. The CNN-based segmentation method can provide an automatic tool for the segmentation of abdominal muscle. As a result, the time required to obtain information about changes in abdominal muscle using the CNN takes a fraction of the time associated with manual segmentation methods and thus can provide a useful tool in the clinical application.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Preoperative anemia is a common and potentially serious hematological problem in elective surgery and increases the risk for perioperative red blood cell (RBC) transfusion. Transfusion is associated with postoperative morbidity and mortality. Preoperative intravenous (IV) iron therapy has been proposed as an intervention to reduce perioperative transfusion; however, studies are generally small, limited, and inconclusive. METHODS/DESIGN: We propose performing a systematic review and meta-analysis. We will search MEDLINE, EMBASE, EBM Reviews, Cochrane-controlled trial registry, Scopus, registries of health technology assessment and clinical trials, Web of Science, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, and conference proceedings in transfusion, hematology, and surgery. We will contact our study drug manufacturer for unpublished trials. Titles and abstracts will be identified and assessed by two reviewers for potential relevance. Eligible studies are: randomized or quasi-randomized clinical trials comparing preoperative administration of IV iron with placebo or standard of care to reduce perioperative blood transfusion in anemic patients undergoing major surgery. Screening, data extraction, and quality appraisal will be conducted independently by two authors. Data will be presented in evidence tables and in meta-analytic forest plots. Primary efficacy outcomes are change in hemoglobin concentration and proportion of patients requiring RBC transfusion. Secondary outcomes include number of units of blood or blood products transfused perioperatively, transfusion-related acute lung injury, neurologic complications, adverse events, postoperative infections, cardiopulmonary complications, intensive care unit (ICU) admission/readmission, length of hospital stay, acute kidney injury, and mortality. Dichotomous outcomes will be reported as pooled relative risks and 95\% confidence intervals. Continuous outcomes will be reported using calculated weighted mean differences. Meta-regression will be performed to evaluate the impact of potential confounding variables on study effect estimates. DISCUSSION: Reducing unnecessary RBC transfusions in perioperative medicine is a clinical priority. This involves the identification of patients at risk of receiving transfusions along with blood conservation strategies. Of potential pharmacological blood conservation strategies, IV iron is a compelling intervention to treat preoperative anemia; however, existing data are uncertain. We propose performing a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating the efficacy and safety of IV iron administration to anemic patients undergoing major surgery to reduce transfusion and perioperative morbidity and mortality.

During short-term starvation (first few days) the following differences are reported: hyperketonaemia is typically 2-fold greater in lean subjects, but associated with a 2-fold lower uptake of ketone bodies by forearm muscle; glucose tolerance becomes impaired more in lean subjects; and both protein turnover and leucine oxidation increase in the lean, but may show no significant change in the obese. It is no longer acceptable to describe the metabolic response to starvation as a single typical response. The differences between lean and obese subjects have important physiological implications, some of which are of obvious relevance to survival.},

BACKGROUND: With improved oncologic outcomes in esophageal cancer, there is an increasing focus on functional status and health-related quality of life in survivorship. Early satiety and weight loss are common after esophagectomy, but the pathophysiology of these phenomena remains poorly understood. METHODS: In this prospective study, consecutive patients undergoing esophagectomy with gastric conduit reconstruction were studied preoperatively and at 10 days, 6 weeks, and 3 months postoperatively. Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) immunoreactivity of plasma collected immediately before and at 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 minutes after a standardized 400-kcal mixed meal was determined. Gastrointestinal symptom scores were computed using European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer questionnaires. RESULTS: Body weight loss at 6 weeks and 3 months postoperatively among 13 patients undergoing esophagectomy was 11.1{$\mkern1mu\pm\mkern1mu$}2.3\% (P {$<$} 0.001) and 16.3{$\mkern1mu\pm\mkern1mu$}2.2\% (P {$<$} 0.0001), respectively. Early satiety (P = 0.043), gastrointestinal pain and discomfort (P = 0.01), altered taste (P= 0.006), and diarrhea (P= 0.038) scores increased at 3 months postoperatively. Area under the curve for the satiety gut hormone GLP-1 was significantly increased from 10 days postoperatively (2.4{$\mkern1mu\pm\mkern1mu$}0.2-fold increase, P {$<$} 0.01), and GLP-1 peak increased 3.8{$\mkern1mu\pm\mkern1mu$}0.6-, 4.7{$\mkern1mu\pm\mkern1mu$}0.8-, and 4.4{$\mkern1mu\pm\mkern1mu$}0.5-fold at 10 days, 6 weeks, and 3 months postoperatively (all P {$<$} 0.0001). Three months postoperatively, GLP-1 area under the curve was associated with early satiety (P = 0.0002, R = 0.74), eating symptoms (P = 0.007, R = 0.54), and trouble enjoying meals (P = 0.0004, R = 0.73). CONCLUSIONS: After esophagectomy, patients demonstrate an exaggerated postprandial satiety gut hormone response, which may mediate postoperative changes in satiety, body weight, and gastrointestinal quality of life.},

SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Sarcopenia in cancer may confer negative outcomes, but its prevalence and impact on modern multimodal regimens for LAEC have not been systematically studied. METHODS: Two hundred fifty-two consecutive patients were studied. Lean body mass (LBM), skeletal muscle index (SMI), and fat mass (FM) were determined pre-treatment, preoperatively, and 1 year postoperatively. Sarcopenia was defined by computed tomography (CT) at L3 as SMI {$<$} 52.4{$\mkern1mu$}cm/m for males and SMI {$<$} 38.5{$\mkern1mu$}cm/m for females. All complications were recorded prospectively, including comprehensive complications index (CCI), Clavien-Dindo complication (CDC), and pulmonary complications (PPCs). Multivariable linear, logistic, and Cox regression analysis was performed. RESULTS: In-hospital mortality was 1\%, and CCI was 21{$\mkern1mu\pm\mkern1mu$}19. Sarcopenia increased (P = 0.02) from 16\% at diagnosis to 31\% post-neoadjuvant therapy, with loss of LBM (-3.0{$\mkern1mu\pm\mkern1mu$}5.4{$\mkern1mu$}kg, P {$<$} 0.0001), but not FM (-0.3{$\mkern1mu\pm\mkern1mu$}2.7{$\mkern1mu$}kg, P= 0.31) during treatment. On multivariable analysis, preoperative sarcopenia was associated with CCI (P = 0.043), and CDC {$\geq$}IIIb (P = 0.003). PPCs occurred in 36\% nonsarcopenic versus 55\% sarcopenic patients (P = 0.01). Sarcopenia did not impact disease-specific (P = 0.14) or overall survival (P = 0.11) after resection. At 1 year, 35\% had sarcopenia, significantly associated with pre-treatment BMI (P = 0.013) but not complications (P = 0.20). CONCLUSIONS: Sarcopenia increases through multimodal therapy, is associated with an increased risk of major postoperative complications, and is prevalent in survivorship. These data highlight a potentially modifiable marker of risk that should be assessed and targeted in modern multimodal care pathways.},

  abstract = {Purpose Racial/ethnic disparities in cancer survival in the United States are well documented, but the underlying causes are not well understood. We quantified the contribution of tumor, treatment, hospital, sociodemographic, and neighborhood factors to racial/ethnic survival disparities in California. Materials and Methods California Cancer Registry data were used to estimate population-based cancer-specific survival for patients diagnosed with breast, prostate, colorectal, or lung cancer between 2000 and 2013 for each racial/ethnic group (non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, Asian American and Pacific Islander, and separately each for Chinese, Japanese, and Filipino) compared with non-Hispanic whites. The percentage contribution of factors to overall racial/ethnic survival disparities was estimated from a sequence of multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. Results In baseline models, black patients had the lowest survival for all cancer sites, and Asian American and Pacific Islander patients had the highest, compared with whites. Mediation analyses suggested that stage at diagnosis had the greatest influence on overall racial/ethnic survival disparities accounting for 24\% of disparities in breast cancer, 24\% in prostate cancer, and 16\% to 30\% in colorectal cancer. Neighborhood socioeconomic status was an important factor in all cancers, but only for black and Hispanic patients. The influence of marital status on racial/ethnic disparities was stronger in men than in women. Adjustment for all covariables explained approximately half of the overall survival disparities in breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer, but it explained only 15\% to 40\% of disparities in lung cancer. Conclusion Overall reductions in racial/ethnic survival disparities were driven largely by reductions for black compared with white patients. Stage at diagnosis had the largest effect on racial/ethnic survival disparities, but earlier detection would not entirely eliminate them. The influences of neighborhood socioeconomic status and marital status suggest that social determinants, support mechanisms, and access to health care are important contributing factors.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Insertion of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is standard care for many patients with oropharyngeal (ENT) and esophageal malignancies in order to ensure enteral feeding. The current pull-through insertion technique involves direct contact with the tumor and case reports have demonstrated the presence of metastases at insertion sites. The aim of the current study was to prospectively evaluate the risk of malignant cell seeding and the development of abdominal wall metastases after PEG placement. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 50 consecutive patients with ENT/esophageal tumors were included. After PEG placement (40 pull-through technique, 10 direct insertion), brush cytology was taken from the PEG tubing and the transcutaneous incision site. A second cytological assessment was performed after a follow-up period of 3 - 6 months. RESULTS: In total, 26 patients with ENT cancer, 13 with esophageal cancer, and one with esophageal infiltration of lung cancer underwent pull-through PEG placement with no immediate complications. Cytology following brushing of tubing and incision sites demonstrated malignant cells in 9 /40 cases (22.5 \%). Correlation analyses revealed a higher rate of malignant seeding in older patients and in those with higher tumor stages. At follow-up, cytology was undertaken in 32 /40 patients who had undergone pull-through PEG placement. Malignant cells were present in three on cytology, resulting in a metastatic seeding rate of 9.4 \%. CONCLUSION: This study showed that malignant cells were present in 22.5 \% of patients immediately after pull-through PEG placement; local metastases were verified at follow-up in 9.4 \%, all of which were from esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. This risk is particularly high in the older age group and in patients with higher tumor stages. Therefore, pull-through PEG placement should be avoided in these patients and direct access PEG favored instead.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Black patients with esophageal cancer have worse survival than white patients. This study examines this racial disparity in conjunction with socioeconomic status (SES) and explores whether race-based outcome differences exist using a national database. METHODS: The associations between race and SES with overall survival of patients treated with esophagectomy for stages I to III esophageal cancer between 2003 and 2011 in the National Cancer Data Base were investigated using the Kaplan-Meier method and proportional hazards analyses. Median income by zip code and proportion of the zip code residents without a high school diploma were grouped into income and education quartiles, respectively and used as surrogates for SES. The association between race and overall survival stratified by SES is explored. RESULTS: Of 11,599 esophagectomy patients who met study criteria, 3,503 (30.2\%) were in the highest income quartile, 2,847 (24.5\%) were in the highest education quartile, and 610 patients (5\%) were black. Before adjustment for SES, black patients had worse overall survival than white patients (median survival 23.0 versus 34.7 months, log rank p {$<$} 0.001), and overall, survival times improved with increasing income and education (p~{$<$} 0.001 for both). After adjustment for putative prognostic factors, SES was associated with overall survival, whereas race was not. CONCLUSIONS: Prior studies have suggested that survival of esophageal cancer patients after esophagectomy is associated with race. Our study suggests that race is not significantly related to overall survival when adjusted for other prognostic variables. Socioeconomic status, however, remains significantly related to overall survival in our model.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Studies have reported potential underuse of surgical resection in black patients with nonmetastatic colorectal cancer. Our objective was to determine the independent, adverse effect of race on surgical resection, controlling for tumor location, comorbidity, and socioeconomic/insurance status. METHODS: All cases of nonmetastatic colon/rectal cancer reported to our state's Central Cancer Registry from 1996 to 2002 were identified and linked to Inpatient/Outpatient Surgery Files and the 2000 Census. Comorbidity (Deyo-Charlson Index) was calculated using ICD-9-CM codes and educational level/income were estimated at the zip code level. Characteristics between whites and blacks were compared using [chi]2 tests. Odds ratios (OR) of resection were calculated using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: We identified 5590/1932 white and 1906/466 black patients with colon/rectal cancer. Blacks were more likely to be younger, not married, rural, less educated, live in poverty, and uninsured/covered by Medicaid compared with whites (all P {$<$} 0.001). Underuse of surgery was far greater among blacks with rectal cancer (82.0\% vs. 89.3\% in whites, P{$<$} 0.001) compared with blacks with colon cancer (92.9\% vs. 94.5\% in whites, P {$<$} 0.001). After controlling for comorbidity/socioeconomic/insurance status and tumor location, the adjusted OR (95\% CI) for resection for blacks with colon cancer and blacks with rectal cancer living in poverty were 0.67 (0.51\textendash 0.88) and 0.20 (0.07\textendash 0.57), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Black race is a powerful, independent predictor of underuse of surgery in rectal cancer patients living in poverty. It is incumbent on the gastroenterology/surgical community to determine whether misperceptions about rectal surgery or barriers to successfully navigating multidisciplinary, rectal cancer care may account for these disparities.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: During the last decade, oncologists and geriatricians have begun to work together to integrate the principles of geriatrics into oncology care. The increasing use of a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) is one example of this effort. A CGA includes an evaluation of an older individual's functional status, comorbid medical conditions, cognition, nutritional status, psychological state, and social support; and a review of the patient's medications. This article discusses recent advances on the use of a CGA in older patients with cancer. METHODS: In this article, we provide an update on the studies that address the domains of a geriatric assessment applied to the oncology patient, review the results of the first studies evaluating the use of a CGA in developing interventions to improve the care of older adults with cancer, and discuss future research directions. RESULTS: The evidence from recent studies demonstrates that a CGA can predict morbidity and mortality in older patients with cancer. Accumulating data show the benefits of incorporating a CGA in the evaluation of older patients with cancer. Prospective trials evaluating the utility of a CGA to guide interventions to improve the quality of cancer care in older adults are justified. CONCLUSION: Growing evidence demonstrates that the variables examined in a CGA can predict morbidity and mortality in older patients with cancer, and uncover problems relevant to cancer care that would otherwise go unrecognized.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: As more and more cancers occur in elderly people, oncologists are increasingly confronted with the necessity of integrating geriatric parameters in the treatment of their patients. METHODS: The International Society of Geriatric Oncology (SIOG) created a task force to review the evidence on the use of a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) in cancer patients. A systematic review of the evidence was conducted. RESULTS: Several biological and clinical correlates of aging have been identified. Their relative weight and clinical usefulness is still poorly defined. There is strong evidence that a CGA detects many problems missed by a regular assessment in general geriatric and in cancer patients. There is also strong evidence that a CGA improves function and reduces hospitalization in the elderly. There is heterogeneous evidence that it improves survival and that it is cost-effective. There is corroborative evidence from a few studies conducted in cancer patients. Screening tools exist and were successfully used in settings such as the emergency room, but globally were poorly tested. The article contains recommendations for the use of CGA in research and clinical care for older cancer patients. CONCLUSIONS: A CGA, with or without screening, and with follow-up, should be used in older cancer patients, in order to detect unaddressed problems, improve their functional status, and possibly their survival. The task force cannot recommend any specific tool or approach above others at this point and general geriatric experience should be used.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tools are lacking to assess the individual risk of severe toxicity from chemotherapy. Such tools would be especially useful for older patients, who vary considerably in terms of health status and functional reserve. METHODS: The authors conducted a prospective, multicentric study of patients aged {$\geq$}70 years who were starting chemotherapy. Grade 4 hematologic (H) or grade 3/4 nonhematologic (NH) toxicity according to version 3.0 of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events was defined as severe. Twenty-four parameters were assessed. Toxicity of the regimen (Chemotox) was adjusted using an index to estimate the average per-patient risk of chemotherapy toxicity (the MAX2 index). In total, 562 patients were accrued, and 518 patients were evaluable and were split randomly (2:1 ratio) into a derivation cohort and a validation cohort. RESULTS: Severe toxicity was observed in 64\% of patients. The Chemotherapy Risk Assessment Scale for High-Age Patients (CRASH) score was constructed along 2 subscores: H toxicity and NH toxicity. Predictors of H toxicity were lymphocytes, aspartate aminotransferase level, Instrumental Activities of Daily Living score, lactate dehydrogenase level, diastolic blood pressure, and Chemotox. The best model included the 4 latter predictors (risk categories: low, 7\%; medium-low, 23\%; medium-high, 54\%; and high, 100\%, respectively; P(trend) {$<$} .001). Predictors of NH toxicity were hemoglobin, creatinine clearance, albumin, self-rated health, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance, Mini-Mental Status score, Mini-Nutritional Assessment score, and Chemotox. The 4 latter predictors provided the best model (risk categories: 33\%, 46\%, 67\%, and 93\%, respectively; P(trend) {$<$} .001). The combined risk categories were 50\%, 58\%, 77\%, and 79\%, respectively; P(trend) {$<$} .001). Bootstrap internal validation and independent sample validation demonstrated stable risk categorization and P(trend) {$<$} .001. CONCLUSIONS: The CRASH score distinguished several risk levels of severe toxicity. The split score discriminated better than the combined score. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first score systematically integrating both chemotherapy and patient risk for older patients and has a potential for future clinical application.},

Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (PS) 2 patients may receive pembrolizumab, despite the absence of sustaining evidence. PATIENTS AND METHODS: GOIRC-2018-01 is a multicentre, retrospective, observational study. PS 2 NSCLC patients with a PD-L1 TPS {$\geq$}50\% receiving first-line pembrolizumab from June 2017 to December 2018 at 21 Italian institutions were included. Clinical-pathological characteristics were correlated with disease response and survival outcomes; adverse events were recorded. The primary objective was 6-months progression-free rate (6-months PFR). RESULTS: One hundred fifty-three patients (median age 70 years) were enrolled. At a median follow-up of 18.2 months, median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 2.4 (95\% confidence interval, 95\% CI, 1.6-2.5) and 3.0 months (95\% CI 2.4-3.5), respectively. 6-months PFR was 27\% (95\% CI 21-35\%). Patients with a PS 2 determined by comorbidities (n~=~41) had significantly better outcomes compared with disease burden-induced PS 2 (n~=~112). Indeed, 6-months PFR was 49\% versus 19\%, median PFS 5.6 versus 1.8 months and OS 11.8 versus 2.8 months, respectively. Additional potential prognostic factors (radiotherapy, antibiotics, steroids received before pembrolizumab) correlated with clinical outcomes. The determinant of PS 2 resulted the only factor independently impacting on both PFS and OS. No toxicity issues emerged. CONCLUSIONS: Outcomes of PS 2 NSCLC patients with PD-L1 TPS {$\geq$}50\% receiving first-line pembrolizumab were globally dismal~but strongly dependent on the reason conditioning the poor PS itself.},

  abstract = {Background: The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) has proposed using procedure-based hierarchical models to predict adverse outcomes, but it is not clear whether this approach was used to develop the NSQIP ``Surgical Risk Calculator''. We therefore wished to demonstrate how procedure-based hierarchical models can be constructed and to describe their results. Methods: NSQIP data from 2015 were used to construct statistical models predicting 30-day postoperative mortality and morbidity, using two-level logistic regression with preoperative patient-level variables as fixed effects and procedure-specific codes as a random intercept. Model performance was validated using NSQIP data from 2014. Results: NSQIP for 2015 contained records for 885,502 patients, of whom 8986 died (1.0\%) and 104,836 suffered a complication (11.8\%). Complete model specifications and results are presented, including odds ratios for patient-level variable effects and random procedure effects. Most comorbidities were associated with increased morbidity and mortality, but overweight and obesity were associated with lower risk. Odds ratios for individual procedures ranged from 0.117 to 10.85 for mortality and from 0.615 to 8.09 for morbidity. Validation C-statistics were 0.940 for the mortality model and 0.833 for the morbidity model; Brier Scores were 0.0086 and 0.085, respectively. Graphs for 20 quantiles showed good conformity of observed and predicted risk. Conclusions: Procedure-based hierarchical logistic regression models of NSQIP outcomes had satisfactory overall performance statistics. Model specifications and results are provided for criticism and improvement, and several possible refinements are suggested.},

METHODS: In this population-based study, all patients with potentially curable EC (cT1N+/cT2-3, TX, any cN, cM0) diagnosed in the South East of the Netherlands between 2004 and 2014 were included. Kaplan-Meier method with log-rank tests and multivariable Cox regression analysis were used to compare overall survival (OS). RESULTS: A total of 702 patients was included. Age {$\geq$}\,75~years and multiple comorbidities were associated with a higher probability for dCRT (odds ratio [OR] 8.58; 95\% confidence interval [CI] 4.72-15.58; and OR 3.09; 95\% CI 1.93-4.93). The strongest associations were found for the combination of hypertension plus diabetes (OR 3.80; 95\% CI 1.97-7.32) and the combination of cardiovascular with pulmonary comorbidity (OR 3.18; 95\% CI 1.57-6.46). Patients with EC who underwent dCRT had a poorer prognosis than those who underwent nCRT plus surgery, irrespective of age, number, and type of comorbidities. In contrast, for patients with squamous cell carcinoma with {$\geq$}\,2 comorbidities or age {$\geq$}\,75~years, OS was comparable between both groups (hazard ratio [HR] 1.52; 95\% CI 0.78-2.97; and HR 0.73; 95\% CI 0.13-4.14). CONCLUSIONS: Histological tumor type should be acknowledged in treatment choices for patients with esophageal cancer. Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy plus surgery should basically be advised as treatment of choice for operable esophageal adenocarcinoma patients. For patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma with {$\geq$}\,2 comorbidities or age {$\geq$}\,75~years, dCRT may be the preferred strategy.},

OBJECTIVE: To compare surgical outcomes for patients who received preoperative PEG and those without PEG placement (No-PEG) insertion prior to surgery in a potentially operable EC. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify randomized and non-randomized studies comparing PEG and No-PEG groups. RESULTS: Four retrospective studies with a total number of 1,027 patients were identified and included in this meta-analysis. The differences in anastomotic leakage, anastomotic stricture, morbidity, pulmonary complications, wound infection, and hospital stay were not statistically significant between the two groups. Operation time was significantly shorter in the PEG group. There was no PEG-related gastric conduit failure and no leak from the PEG site in the PEG group. CONCLUSION: We conclude preoperative PEG for resectable EC is a safe procedure with no adverse effect on the gastric tube construction and anastomosis, it can be selectively inserted for EC patients with marked weight loss and malnutrition or those at risk of developing malnutrition during neoadjuvant therapy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Older patients are often considered high-risk surgical candidates for locally advanced esophageal cancer, and the benefit of surgery in this population is unclear. This national analysis examines the effect of age on esophagectomy outcomes and compares surgery versus chemoradiation in older patients. METHODS: The National Cancer Database was used to identify patients with clinical stage II to III esophageal adenocarcinoma undergoing surgery or definitive chemoradiation between 2004 and 2015. Restricted cubic splines were used to examine the relationship between age and survival after esophagectomy, and maximally selected rank statistics were used to identify an age at which survival worsened. We used Cox proportional hazard models including an interaction term between age and treatment to compare overall survival, as well as survival of patients receiving esophagectomy versus definitive chemoradiation. RESULTS: Of 17,495 patients, 11,680 underwent esophagectomy and 5815 received chemoradiation. Survival after esophagectomy worsened with increasing age and decreased considerably after age 73 (hazard ratio~= 1.05, 95\% confidence interval, 1.04-1.06, per increasing year after 73 versus hazard ratio~= 1.01, 95\% confidence interval, 1.00-1.01, per increasing year to 73; both P {$<$} .001). Chemoradiation was increasingly used over surgery as age increased. The interaction between age and treatment was significant, and a graph of this interaction demonstrated a survival benefit for surgery over chemoradiation at most ages, including octogenarians. CONCLUSIONS: Survival worsens with age after esophagectomy for locally advanced esophageal cancer. However, esophagectomy is associated with improved survival compared with definitive chemoradiation at most ages, including octogenarians. Esophagectomy may be considered over chemoradiation for patients who can tolerate surgery regardless of age.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: For many chemotherapy regimens dosed based on body surface area (BSA), patients experience dose reductions or delays or discontinue treatment, thereby reducing survival. Consideration of body composition may be useful in individualizing chemotherapy dosing, but to the authors' knowledge few studies to date have examined the association of body composition with chemotherapy tolerance in patients with colon cancer. METHODS: The authors identified patients with nonmetastatic colon cancer who were diagnosed from 2006 through 2011 at Kaiser Permanente and who received leucovorin calcium/calcium folinate, 5-fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) as initial adjuvant chemotherapy (533 patients). Patients' muscle mass was quantified using clinically acquired computed tomography scans. The authors quantified chemotherapy doses, treatment dates, and related toxicities using the electronic medical record. In logistic regression models adjusting for age, sex, and American Joint Committee on Cancer stage of disease, the authors examined associations of muscle tertiles with early treatment discontinuation ({$<$}6 cycles), treatment delay ({$>$}3 days off schedule for  3 times), and/or dose reduction (relative dose intensity   0.70, based on planned treatment). RESULTS: The average age of the patients at the time of diagnosis was 58.7 years; BSA was 1.9 m2 and body mass index was 28.7 kg/m2. Compared with the highest sex-specific tertile of muscle mass, patients in the lowest tertile were more likely to experience toxicities and had twice the risk of adverse outcomes while receiving FOLFOX; for early discontinuation, the odds ratio (OR) was 2.34 (95\% confidence interval [95\% CI], 1.04-5.24; P for trend 5 .03), whereas the ORs were 2.24 (95\% CI, 1.37-3.66; P for trend 5 .002) for treatment delay and 2.28 (95\% CI, 1.19-4.36; P for trend 5 .01) for dose reduction. CONCLUSIONS: Lower muscle mass is associated with greater toxicity and poor chemotherapy adherence among patients receiving FOLFOX. Many chemotherapy drugs are dosed based on BSA, but treatment may be better individualized if muscle mass is considered. Cancer 2017;123:4868-77. VC 2017 American Cancer Society.},

  abstract = {Importance: Systemic inflammation and sarcopenia are easily evaluated, predict mortality in many cancers, and are potentially modifiable. The combination of inflammation and sarcopenia may be able to identify patients with early-stage colorectal cancer (CRC) with poor prognosis. Objective: To examine associations of prediagnostic systemic inflammation with at-diagnosis sarcopenia, and determine whether these factors interact to predict CRC survival, adjusting for age, ethnicity, sex, body mass index, stage, and cancer site. Design, Setting, and Participants: A prospective cohort of 2470 Kaiser Permanente patients with stage I to III CRC diagnosed from 2006 through 2011. Exposures: Our primary measure of inflammation was the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR). We averaged NLR in the 24 months before diagnosis (mean count\,=\,3 measures; mean time before diagnosis\,=\,7 mo). The reference group was NLR of less than 3, indicating low or no inflammation. Main Outcomes and Measures: Using computed tomography scans, we calculated skeletal muscle index (muscle area at the third lumbar vertebra divided by squared height). Sarcopenia was defined as less than 52 cm2/m2 and less than 38 cm2/m2 for normal or overweight men and women, respectively, and less than 54 cm2/m2 and less than 47 cm2/m2 for obese men and women, respectively. The main outcome was death (overall or CRC related). Results: Among 2470 patients, 1219 (49\%) were female; mean (SD) age was 63 (12) years. An NLR of 3 or greater and sarcopenia were common (1133 [46\%] and 1078 [44\%], respectively). Over a median of 6 years of follow-up, we observed 656 deaths, 357 from CRC. Increasing NLR was associated with sarcopenia in a dose-response manner (compared with NLR\,{$<$}\,3, odds ratio,\,1.35; 95\% CI, 1.10-1.67 for NLR 3 to {$<$}5; 1.47; 95\% CI, 1.16-1.85 for NLR\,{$\geq$}\,5; P for trend\,{$<$}\,.001). An NLR of 3 or greater and sarcopenia independently predicted overall (hazard ratio [HR], 1.64; 95\% CI, 1.40-1.91 and HR, 1.28; 95\% CI, 1.10-1.53, respectively) and CRC-related death (HR, 1.71; 95\% CI, 1.39-2.12 and HR, 1.42; 95\% CI, 1.13-1.78, respectively). Patients with both sarcopenia and NLR of 3 or greater (vs neither) had double the risk of death, overall (HR, 2.12; 95\% CI, 1.70-2.65) and CRC related (HR, 2.43; 95\% CI, 1.79-3.29). Conclusions and Relevance: Prediagnosis inflammation was associated with at-diagnosis sarcopenia. Sarcopenia combined with inflammation nearly doubled risk of death, suggesting that these commonly collected biomarkers could enhance prognostication. A better understanding of how the host inflammatory/immune response influences changes in skeletal muscle may open new therapeutic avenues to improve cancer outcomes.},

However, analgesic regimens for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery vary significantly. The goal of this systematic review was to evaluate the available literature and develop recommendations for optimal pain management after video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. A systematic review was undertaken using procedure-specific postoperative pain management (PROSPECT) methodology. Randomised controlled trials published in the English language, between January 2010 and January 2021 assessing the effect of analgesic, anaesthetic or surgical interventions were identified. We retrieved 1070 studies of which 69 randomised controlled trials and two reviews met inclusion criteria. We recommend the administration of basic analgesia including paracetamol and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or cyclo-oxygenase-2-specific inhibitors pre-operatively or intra-operatively and continued postoperatively. Intra-operative intravenous dexmedetomidine infusion may be used, specifically when basic analgesia and regional analgesic techniques could not be given. In addition, a paravertebral block or erector spinae plane block is recommended as a first-choice option. A serratus anterior plane block could also be administered as a second-choice option. Opioids should be reserved as rescue analgesics in the postoperative period.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Current information about outcomes in octogenarians undergoing cancer operations is limited largely to case series from selected centers. Population-based data can provide more realistic estimates of the risks and benefits of operations in this group. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing major resections for lung, esophageal, and pancreas cancer. Using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (1994 to 2003), we examined operative mortality and discharge disposition in octogenarians (aged 80+ years), relative to younger patients (aged 65 to 69 years) (n = 272,662). We then used the Surveillance and End Results-Medicare-linked database (1992 to 2001) to measure late survival in the elderly (n = 14,088). RESULTS: Operative mortality among octogenarians was substantially higher than that of younger patients (aged 65 to 69 years) for all three cancers (esophagectomy, 19.9\% versus 8.8\%, p {$<$} 0.0001; pancreatectomy, 15.5\% versus 6.7\%, p {$<$} 0.0001; lung resection, 6.9\% versus 3.7\%, p {$<$} 0.0001). A large proportion of octogenarians were transferred to extended care facilities after operation, ranging from 24\% after lung resection to 44\% after esophagectomy. Five-year survival in octogenarians was low for all three cancers: 11\% after pancreatectomy, 18\% after esophagectomy and 31\% after lung cancer resection. Survival among octogenarians with two or more comorbidities was worse than those with fewer comorbid diagnoses--10\% versus 14\% for pancreatectomy, 15\% versus 23\% for esophagectomy, and 27\% versus 37\% for lung resection. CONCLUSIONS: Population-based outcomes after high-risk cancer operation in octogenarians are considerably worse than typically reported in case series and published survival statistics. Such information might better inform clinical decision making in this high-risk group.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-four patients with carcinomas of the esophagus (n = 43) or gastroesophageal junction (n = 31) were studied. All patients underwent attenuation-corrected FDG-PET imaging, a spiral computed tomography (CT) scan, and an endoscopic ultrasound (EUS). RESULTS: FDG-PET demonstrated increased activity in the primary tumor in 70 of 74 patients (sensitivity: 95\%). False-negative PET images were found in four patients with T1 lesions. Thirty-four patients (46\%) had stage IV disease. FDG-PET had a higher accuracy for diagnosing stage IV disease compared with the combination of CT and EUS (82\% v 64\%, respectively; P: =.004). FDG-PET had additional diagnostic value in 16 (22\%) of 74 patients by upstaging 11 (15\%) and downstaging five (7\%) patients. Thirty-nine (53\%) of the 74 patients underwent a 2- or 3-field lymphadenectomy in conjunction with primary curative esophagectomy. In these patients, tumoral involvement was found in 21 local and 35 regional or distant lymph nodes (LN). For local LN, the sensitivity of FDG-PET was lower than EUS (33\% v 81\%, respectively; P: =.027), but the specificity may have been higher (89\% v 67\%, respectively; P: = not significant [NS]). For the assessment of regional and distant LN involvement, compared with the combined use of CT and EUS, FDG-PET had a higher specificity (90\% v 98\%, respectively; P: =. 025) and a similar sensitivity (46\% v 43\%, respectively; P: = NS). CONCLUSION: PET significantly improves the detection of stage IV disease in EC compared with the conventional staging modalities. PET improves diagnostic specificity for LN staging.},

The impact of therapeutic targeting of IGF-1 on muscle mass is unknown. METHODS: We evaluated muscle mass at L3 in patients enrolled in a randomized phase II study of MK-0646 (M), a monoclonal antibody directed against the IGF-1 protein, in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer (MPC). Two different doses of M were tested, 5 and 10~mg/kg. We used the Slice-o-matic (ver 4.3) software to segregate CT images into muscle and fat components and measured muscle area (cm(2)) at baseline and after 2 and 4~months of treatment. Patients received either gemcitabine with erlotinib (G\,+\,E), G\,+\,E\,+\,M, or G\,+\,M. Differences between the groups were compared using t tests. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients had both baseline and 2-month imaging available for analysis. Of these, 42 received M with their chemo, and 11 had G\,+\,E only. After 2~months of treatment, both groups demonstrated decrease in muscle mass. G\,+\,E patients lost 5.6~\% of muscle mass; M patients lost 9.1 and 8.6~\% after treatment with 5 and 10~mg/kg, respectively (p\,=\,0.53). Patients demonstrating a response lost less muscle (median 4.6~\%) than those with stable disease (9.6~\%) and progressive disease (8.9~\%, p\,=\,0.14). Muscle retention from baseline to 2-month imaging, defined as loss of {$<$}6~cm(2) of muscle, correlated with better survival than those patients demonstrating a muscle loss (HR 0.51, p\,=\,0.03). CONCLUSIONS: MPC patients can be expected to lose muscle mass even while having clinical benefit (PR or SD) from chemotherapy. Muscle loss correlated with a risk of study drop-out and death. There was a non-significant trend toward greater muscle mass loss in patients on anti-IGF-1R therapy. However, it is unclear if this loss translates into functional differences between patients.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Guidelines support the use of a restrictive strategy in blood transfusion management in a variety of clinical settings. However, recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) performed in the perioperative setting suggest a beneficial effect on survival of a liberal strategy. We aimed to assess the effect of liberal and restrictive blood transfusion strategies on mortality in perioperative and critically ill adult patients through a meta-analysis of RCTs. METHODS: We searched PubMed/Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Transfusion Evidence Library, and Google Scholar up to 27 March 2015, for RCTs performed in perioperative or critically ill adult patients, receiving a restrictive or liberal transfusion strategy, and reporting all-cause mortality. We used a fixed or random-effects model to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and 95\% confidence interval (CI) for pooled data. We assessed heterogeneity using Cochrane's Q and I(2) tests. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality within 90-day follow-up. RESULTS: Patients in the perioperative period receiving a liberal transfusion strategy had lower all-cause mortality when compared with patients allocated to receive a restrictive transfusion strategy (OR 0.81; 95\% CI 0.66-1.00; P=0.05; I(2)=25\%; Number needed to treat=97) with 7552 patients randomized in 17 trials. There was no difference in mortality among critically ill patients receiving a liberal transfusion strategy when compared with the restrictive transfusion strategy (OR 1.10; 95\% CI 0.99-1.23; P=0.07; I(2)=34\%) with 3469 patients randomized in 10 trials. CONCLUSION: According to randomized published evidence, perioperative adult patients have an improved survival when receiving a liberal blood transfusion strategy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Over half of new cancer cases occur in patients aged {$>$} or = 65 years. Many older patients can benefit from intensive cancer therapies, yet evidence suggests that this population is undertreated. METHODS: To assess preferences and influential factors in geriatric cancer management, practicing U.S. medical oncologists completed a survey containing four detailed vignettes exploring colon, breast, lung, and prostate cancer treatment. Participants were randomly assigned one of two surveys with vignettes that were identical except for patient age ({$<$}65 years or {$>$}70 years). RESULTS: Physicians in each survey group (n = 200) were demographically similar. Intensive therapy was significantly less likely to be recommended for an older than for a younger, but otherwise identical, patient in two of the scenarios. For a woman with metastatic colon cancer (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] score, 1) for whom chemotherapy was recommended, nearly all oncologists chose an intensive regimen if the patient's age was 63; but if her age was 85, one fourth of the oncologists chose a less intensive treatment. Likewise, for stage IIA breast cancer (ECOG score, 0), 93\% recommended intensive adjuvant treatment for a previously healthy patient aged 63; but only 66\% said they would do so if the patient's age was 75. Oncologists commonly identified patient age as an influence on treatment choice, but were even more likely to cite performance status as a determining factor. CONCLUSIONS: Advanced age can deter oncologists from choosing intensive cancer therapy, even if patients are highly functional and lack comorbidities. Education on tailoring cancer treatment and a greater use of comprehensive geriatric assessment may reduce cancer undertreatment in the geriatric population.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the risk of heart disease related death (HDRD) following radiation therapy (RT) for esophageal cancer (EC). METHODS: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, two cohorts of patients with EC were created: (I) patients who received RT with their initial therapy; and (II) those who did not. Heart disease specific survival (HDSS) was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier methods. Cox proportional-hazards regression methods were used for univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: We identified 40,778 patients with EC. A total of 26,377 patients received RT and 14,401 did not. HDSS analysis revealed increased risk of HDRD in those receiving RT (P{$<$}0.05), with an absolute risk of HDRD of 2.8\%, 5.3\% and 9.4\% at 5-, 10- and 20-year, respectively. Log rank test of HDSS revealed the risk of HDRD became significant at 8 months (P{$<$}0.05). The following were associated with HDRD: RT, age, race, stage at presentation, time period of diagnosis, and known comorbid condition keeping one from esophagectomy. On multivariate analysis, RT remained predictive of HDRD [hazard ratio (HR) 1.46, P{$<$}0.05]. When considering only candidates for definitive therapy, RT remained predictive of HDRD on univariate (HR 1.53, P{$<$}0.0001) and multivariate (HR 1.62, P{$<$}0.0001) analyses. CONCLUSIONS: The use of RT leads to increased risk of HDRD that is detectable as early as eight months from diagnosis. More research is needed to define optimal dose volume parameters to prevent cardiac death. Consideration should be given to this risk in relation to prognosis and the expected benefits of RT.},

BACKGROUND: A recent multicenter, international randomized controlled trial showed that DOF following a MIE is comparable to standard of care (nil-by-mouth). However, the effect of DOF was potentially influenced by postoperative complications. METHODS: Patients in this single-center prospective cohort study received either DOF (intervention) or nil-by-mouth for 5{$\mkern1mu$}days postoperative and tube feeding (standard of care, control group) following a MIE with intrathoracic anastomosis. Primary outcome was time to functional recovery and length of hospital stay. Secondary outcomes included anastomotic leakage, pneumonia, and other surgical complications. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were similar in the intervention (n = 85) and control (n = 111) group. Median time to functional recovery was 7 and 9{$\mkern1mu$}days in the intervention and control group (P {$<$} 0.001), respectively. Length of hospital stay was 8 versus 10{$\mkern1mu$}days (P {$<$} 0.001), respectively. Thirty-day postoperative complication rate was significantly reduced in the intervention group (57.6\% vs 73.0\%, P = 0.024). Chyle leakage only occurred in the control group (18.9\%, P {$<$} 0.001). Anastomotic leakage, pneumonia, and other postoperative complications did not differ between groups. CONCLUSION: Direct oral feeding following a MIE results in a faster time to functional recovery and lower 30-day postoperative complication rate compared to patients that were orally fasted.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Frailty is considered highly prevalent in old age and to confer high risk for falls, disability, hospitalization, and mortality. Frailty has been considered synonymous with disability, comorbidity, and other characteristics, but it is recognized that it may have a biologic basis and be a distinct clinical syndrome. A standardized definition has not yet been established. METHODS: To develop and operationalize a phenotype of frailty in older adults and assess concurrent and predictive validity, the study used data from the Cardiovascular Health Study. Participants were 5,317 men and women 65 years and older (4,735 from an original cohort recruited in 1989-90 and 582 from an African American cohort recruited in 1992-93). Both cohorts received almost identical baseline evaluations and 7 and 4 years of follow-up, respectively, with annual examinations and surveillance for outcomes including incident disease, hospitalization, falls, disability, and mortality. RESULTS: Frailty was defined as a clinical syndrome in which three or more of the following criteria were present: unintentional weight loss (10 lbs in past year), self-reported exhaustion, weakness (grip strength), slow walking speed, and low physical activity. The overall prevalence of frailty in this community-dwelling population was 6.9\%; it increased with age and was greater in women than men. Four-year incidence was 7.2\%. Frailty was associated with being African American, having lower education and income, poorer health, and having higher rates of comorbid chronic diseases and disability. There was overlap, but not concordance, in the cooccurrence of frailty, comorbidity, and disability. This frailty phenotype was independently predictive (over 3 years) of incident falls, worsening mobility or ADL disability, hospitalization, and death, with hazard ratios ranging from 1.82 to 4.46, unadjusted, and 1.29-2.24, adjusted for a number of health, disease, and social characteristics predictive of 5-year mortality. Intermediate frailty status, as indicated by the presence of one or two criteria, showed intermediate risk of these outcomes as well as increased risk of becoming frail over 3-4 years of follow-up (odds ratios for incident frailty = 4.51 unadjusted and 2.63 adjusted for covariates, compared to those with no frailty criteria at baseline). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a potential standardized definition for frailty in community-dwelling older adults and offers concurrent and predictive validity for the definition. It also finds that there is an intermediate stage identifying those at high risk of frailty. Finally, it provides evidence that frailty is not synonymous with either comorbidity or disability, but comorbidity is an etiologic risk factor for, and disability is an outcome of, frailty. This provides a potential basis for clinical assessment for those who are frail or at risk, and for future research to develop interventions for frailty based on a standardized ascertainment of frailty.},

Twelve healthy untrained volunteers (age range 60-72 yr) participated in a 12-wk strength training program (8 repetitions/set; 3 sets/day; 3 days/wk) at 80\% of the one repetition maximum (1 RM) for extensors and flexors of both knee joints. They were evaluated before the program and after 6 and 12 wk of training. Weekly measurements of 1 RM showed a progressive increase in strength in extensors and flexors. By 12 wk extensor and flexor strength had increased 107.4 (P less than 0.0001) and 226.7\% (P less than 0.0001), respectively. Isokinetic peak torque of extensors and flexors measured on a Cybex II dynamometer increased 10.0 and 18.5\% (P less than 0.05) at 60 degrees/s and 16.7 and 14.7\% (P less than 0.05) at 240 degrees/s. The torque-velocity relationship showed an upward displacement of the curve at the end of training, mainly in the slow-velocity high-torque region. Midthigh composition from computerized tomographic scans showed an increase (P less than 0.01) in total thigh area (4.8\%), total muscle area (11.4\%), and quadriceps area (9.3\%). Biopsies of the vastus lateralis muscle revealed similar increases (P less than 0.001) in type I fiber area (33.5\%) and type II fiber area (27.6\%). Daily excretion of urinary 3-methyl-L-histidine increased with training (P less than 0.05) by an average 40.8\%. Strength gains in older men were associated with significant muscle hypertrophy and an increase in myofibrillar protein turnover.},

METHODS: CSA and SMD were computed on 216 axial CT images obtained at the L3 level in 72 patients with variations in IV contrast, slice thickness and tube current. Intra-patient mean difference (MD), 95 \% CI and limits of agreement were calculated using the Bland-Altman approach. Inter- and intra-analyst agreement was evaluated. RESULTS: IV contrast significantly increased CSA by 1.88 \% (MD 2.33 cm2; 95 \% CI 1.76-2.89) and SMD by 5.99 \% (p{$<$}0.0001). Five mm slice thickness significantly increased mean CSA by 1.11 \% compared to 2 mm images (1.32 cm2; 0.78-1.85) and significantly decreased SMD by 11.64 \% (p{$<$}0.0001). Low tube current significantly decreased mean CSA by 4.79 \% (6.44 cm2; 3.78-9.10) and significantly increased SMD by 46.46 \% (p{$<$}0.0001). Inter- and intra-analyst agreement was excellent. CONCLUSIONS: IV contrast, slice thickness and tube current significantly affect CSA and SMD. Investigators designing and analysing clinical trials using CT for body composition analysis should report CT acquisition parameters and consider the effect of slice thickness, IV contrast and tube current on myometric data. KEY POINTS: \textbullet{} Intravenous contrast, slice thickness and tube current significantly affect myometric data. \textbullet{} Image acquisition parameter variations may obscure intrapatient muscle differences on serial measurements. \textbullet{} Investigators using CT for body composition analysis should report CT acquisition parameters.},

The comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) represents the gold-standard for (1) defining prognosis and ability to withstand cancer treatments, (2) exploring the multiple aspects that define the complexity of frail older persons, and (3) designing person-tailored interventions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this document, based on a comprehensive revision of the literature, the Italian Society for Geriatrics and Gerontology proposes a CGA model (ONCOGER CGA) to be adopted by oncology centers for their routine approach to older patients with cancer. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: A widespread use of this standardized CGA format will facilitate comparisons across institutions, promote studies based on a multidimensional patient assessment, and foster the inclusion of geriatric endpoints in oncological clinical trials. Furthermore, we predict that the use of a standardized CGA approach will increase the integration of geriatricians into oncology care teams with the final result of improving therapeutic choices and clinical outcomes.},

However, its role in anesthetized patients undergoing major surgery is not known. METHODS: In this multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group trial, we randomly assigned 400 adults at intermediate to high risk of pulmonary complications after major abdominal surgery to either nonprotective mechanical ventilation or a strategy of lung-protective ventilation. The primary outcome was a composite of major pulmonary and extrapulmonary complications occurring within the first 7 days after surgery. RESULTS: The two intervention groups had similar characteristics at baseline. In the intention-to-treat analysis, the primary outcome occurred in 21 of 200 patients (10.5\%) assigned to lung-protective ventilation, as compared with 55 of 200 (27.5\%) assigned to nonprotective ventilation (relative risk, 0.40; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.24 to 0.68; P=0.001). Over the 7-day postoperative period, 10 patients (5.0\%) assigned to lung-protective ventilation required noninvasive ventilation or intubation for acute respiratory failure, as compared with 34 (17.0\%) assigned to nonprotective ventilation (relative risk, 0.29; 95\% CI, 0.14 to 0.61; P=0.001). The length of the hospital stay was shorter among patients receiving lung-protective ventilation than among those receiving nonprotective ventilation (mean difference, -2.45 days; 95\% CI, -4.17 to -0.72; P=0.006). CONCLUSIONS: As compared with a practice of nonprotective mechanical ventilation, the use of a lung-protective ventilation strategy in intermediate-risk and high-risk patients undergoing major abdominal surgery was associated with improved clinical outcomes and reduced health care utilization.

However, whether myosteatosis and its combination with systemic inflammatory markers are associated with prognosis of esophageal cancer is unknown. Our study aimed to investigate the influence of myosteatosis and its association with systemic inflammation on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in LAEC patients treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy (dCRT). We retrospectively gathered information on 123 patients with LAEC submitted to dCRT at the University of Campinas Hospital. Computed tomography (CT) images at the level of L3 were analyzed to assess muscularity and adiposity. Systemic inflammation was mainly measured by calculating the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR). Median PFS for patients with myosteatosis (n = 72) was 11.0 months vs 4.0 months for patients without myosteatosis (n = 51) (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.53; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.34-0.83; P = .005). Myosteatosis was also independently associated with a favorable OS. Systemic inflammation (NLR {$>$} 2.8) was associated with a worse prognosis. The combination of myosteatosis with systemic inflammation revealed that the subgroup of patients with myosteatosis and without inflammation presented less than half the risk of disease progression (HR: 0.47; 95\% CI: 0.26-0.85; P = .013) and death (HR: 0.39; 95\% CI, 0.21-0.72; P = .003) compared with patients with inflammation. This study demonstrated that myosteatosis without systemic inflammation was independently associated with favorable PFS and OS in LAEC patients treated with dCRT.},

The aim of this study was to assess the physical performance and health related quality of life (HRQOL) of disease free survivors and compare findings in a case matched noncancer control group. Twenty-five males (mean ({$\pm$}SD) aged 63 ({$\pm$}6) years) who were over 6 months postesophagectomy and disease-free were compared with 25 controls (60 {$\pm$} 6 years). Physical functioning was assessed through hand grip strength (dynamometry), exercise capacity (incremental shuttle walk test), physical activity levels (RT3 accelerometer), and body composition (bio-electrical impedance analysis). Health-related quality of life was measured using the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. Esophageal cancer survivors demonstrated significantly lower fitness (P {$<$} 0.001) and time spent in moderate (P {$<$} 0.001) and vigorous (P {$<$} 0.001) intensity physical activity compared with controls. Global health status and quality of life were similar in both groups (P = 0.245); however, physical and role functioning domains were lower in the cancer survivors (P {$<$} 0.001, and P = 0.001, respectively). These data show that disease-free survivors of curative esophageal cancer treatment demonstrate a significant compromise in physical functioning compared with controls, thus highlighting the multiple, complex rehabilitative needs of this cohort.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The management strategies for Barrett's esophagus (BE) that contains high-grade dysplasia (HGD) include intensive endoscopic surveillance, photodynamic therapy, thermal ablation, EMR, and esophagectomy. OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety and effectiveness of endoscopic circumferential balloon-based ablation by using radiofrequency energy for treating BE HGD. DESIGN: Multicenter U.S. registry. SETTING: Sixteen academic and community centers; treatment period from September 2004 to March 2007. PATIENTS: Patients with histologic evidence of intestinal metaplasia (IM) that contained HGD confirmed by at least 2 expert pathologists. A prior EMR was permitted, provided that residual HGD remained in the BE region for ablation. INTERVENTION: Endoscopic circumferential ablation with follow-up esophageal biopsies to assess the histologic response to treatment. OUTCOMES: Histologic complete response (CR) end points: (1) all biopsy specimen fragments obtained at the last biopsy session were negative for HGD (CR-HGD), (2) all biopsy specimens were negative for any dysplasia (CR-D), and (3) all biopsy specimens were negative for IM (CR-IM). RESULTS: A total of 142 patients (median age 66 years, interquartile range [IQR] 59-75 years) who had BE HGD (median length 6 cm, IQR 3-8 cm) underwent circumferential ablation (median 1 session, IQR 1-2). No serious adverse events were reported. There was 1 asymptomatic stricture and no buried glands. Ninety-two patients had at least 1 follow-up biopsy session (median follow-up 12 months, IQR 8-15 months). A CR-HGD was achieved in 90.2\% of patients, CR-D in 80.4\%, and CR-IM in 54.3\%. LIMITATIONS: A nonrandomized study design, without a control arm, a lack of centralized pathology review, ablation and biopsy technique not standardized, and a relatively short-term follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic circumferential ablation is a promising modality for the treatment of BE that contains HGD. In this multicenter registry, the intervention safely achieved a CR for HGD in 90.2\% of patients at a median of 12 months of follow-up.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Prospective data on the efficacy of a watch-and-wait strategy to achieve organ preservation in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer treated with total neoadjuvant therapy are limited. METHODS: In this prospective, randomized phase II trial, we assessed the outcomes of 324 patients with stage II or III rectal adenocarcinoma treated with induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy (INCT-CRT) or chemoradiotherapy followed by consolidation chemotherapy (CRT-CNCT) and either total mesorectal excision (TME) or watch-and-wait on the basis of tumor response. Patients in both groups received 4 months of infusional fluorouracil-leucovorin-oxaliplatin or capecitabine-oxaliplatin and 5,000 to 5,600 cGy of radiation combined with either continuous infusion fluorouracil or capecitabine during radiotherapy. The trial was designed as two stand-alone studies with disease-free survival (DFS) as the primary end point for both groups, with a comparison to a null hypothesis on the basis of historical data. The secondary end point was TME-free survival. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 3 years. Three-year DFS was 76\% (95\% CI, 69 to 84) for the INCT-CRT group and 76\% (95\% CI, 69 to 83) for the CRT-CNCT group, in line with the 3-year DFS rate (75\%) observed historically. Three-year TME-free survival was 41\% (95\% CI, 33 to 50) in the INCT-CRT group and 53\% (95\% CI, 45 to 62) in the CRT-CNCT group. No differences were found between groups in local recurrence-free survival, distant metastasis-free survival, or overall survival. Patients who underwent TME after restaging and patients who underwent TME after regrowth had similar DFS rates. CONCLUSION: Organ preservation is achievable in half of the patients with rectal cancer treated with total neoadjuvant therapy, without an apparent detriment in survival, compared with historical controls treated with chemoradiotherapy, TME, and postoperative chemotherapy.},

We hypothesize that agerelated modifications of body composition (i.e. increased fat mass and decreased lean mass) may significantly affect tolerance to chemotherapy. Method: We conducted a systematic review for the last 25 years (between 1990 and 2015), using US National library of Medicine Medline electronic bibliographic database and Embase database of cohorts or clinical trials exploring (i) the interactions of body composition (assessed by Dual X-ray Absorptiometry, Bioelectrical Impedance Analyses, or Computerized Tomography) with pharmacokinetics parameters, (ii) the tolerance to chemotherapy, and (iii) the consequences of chemotherapies or targeted therapies on body composition. Results: Our search identified 1879 articles. After a selection (using pre-established criteria) on titles and abstract, 24 original articles were selected with 3 domains of interest: impact of body composition on pharmacokinetics (7 articles), relationship between body composition and chemotoxicity (14 articles), and effect of anti-cancer chemotherapy on body composition (11 articles). The selected studies suggested that pharmacokinetic was influenced by lean mass, that lower lean mass could be correlated with toxicity, and that sarcopenic patients experienced more toxicities that non-sarcopenic patients. Regarding fat mass, results were less conclusive. No studies specifically explored the topic of body composition in older cancer patients. Conclusions: Plausible pathophysiological pathways linking body composition, toxicity, and pharmacokinetics are sustained by the actual review. However, despite the growing number of older cancer patients, our review highlighted the lack of specific studies in the field of anti-neoplastic agents toxicity regarding body composition conducted in elderly.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Radiation therapy (RT) for esophageal cancer often results in unintended radiation doses delivered to the heart owing to anatomic proximity. Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, we examined late cardiac death in survivors of esophageal cancer that had or had not received RT. METHODS: 5,630 patients were identified that were diagnosed with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) or adenocarcinoma (AC) from 1973-2012, who were followed for at least 5 years after therapy. Examined risk factors for cardiac death included age ({$\leq$}55/56-65/66-75/{$>$}75), gender, race (white/non-white), stage (local/regional/distant), histology (SCC/AC), esophageal location ({$<$}18cm/18-24cm/25-32cm/33-40cm from incisors), diagnosis year (1973-1992/1993-2002/2003-2012), and receipt of surgery and/or RT. Time to cardiac death was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method. A Cox model was used to evaluate risk factors for cardiac death in propensity score matched data. RESULTS: Patients who received RT were younger, diagnosed more recently, had more advanced disease, SCC histology, and no surgery. The RT group had higher risk of cardiac death than the no-RT group (log-rank p{$<$}0.0001). The median time to cardiac death in the RT group was 289 months (95\% CI, 255-367) and was not reached in the no-RT group. The probability of cardiac death increased with age and decreased with diagnosis year, and this trend was more pronounced in the RT group. Multivariate analysis found RT to be associated with higher probability of cardiac death (OR 1.23, 95\% CI 1.03-1.47, HR 1.961, 95\% CI 1.466-2.624). Lower esophageal subsite (33-40 cm) was also associated with a higher risk of cardiac death. Other variables were not associated with cardiac death. CONCLUSIONS: Recognizing the limitations of a SEER analysis including lack of comorbidity accountability, these data should prompt more definitive study as to whether a possible associative effect of RT on cardiac death could potentially be a causative effect.},

Every 3 years, the American Cancer Society estimates the number of new cancer cases and deaths for Black people in the United States and compiles the most recent data on cancer incidence (herein through 2018), mortality (through 2019), survival, screening, and risk factors using population-based data from the National Cancer Institute and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2022, there will be approximately 224,080 new cancer cases and 73,680 cancer deaths among Black people in the United States. During the most recent 5-year period, Black men had a 6\% higher incidence rate but 19\% higher mortality than White men overall, including an approximately 2-fold higher risk of death from myeloma, stomach cancer, and prostate cancer. The overall cancer mortality disparity is narrowing between Black and White men because of a steeper drop in Black men for lung and prostate cancers. However, the decline in prostate cancer mortality in Black men slowed from 5\% annually during 2010 through 2014 to 1.3\% during 2015 through 2019, likely reflecting the 5\% annual increase in advanced-stage diagnoses since 2012. Black women have an 8\% lower incidence rate than White women but a 12\% higher mortality; further, mortality rates are 2-fold higher for endometrial cancer and 41\% higher for breast cancer despite similar or lower incidence rates. The wide breast cancer disparity reflects both later stage diagnosis (57\% localized stage vs 67\% in White women) and lower 5-year survival overall (82\% vs 92\%, respectively) and for every stage of disease (eg, 20\% vs 30\%, respectively, for distant stage). Breast cancer surpassed lung cancer as the leading cause of cancer death among Black women in 2019. Targeted interventions are needed to reduce stark cancer inequalities in the Black community.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the general US population, blacks and whites have been shown to undergo colon cancer treatment at disproportionate rates. Accessibility to medical care may be the most important factor influencing differences in colon cancer treatment rates among whites and blacks. OBJECTIVE: We assessed whether racial disparities in colon cancer surgery and chemotherapy existed in an equal-access health care system. In addition, we sought to examine whether racial differences varied according to demographic and tumor characteristics. DESIGN AND SETTING: Database research using the Department of Defense Military Health System. PATIENTS: Patients included 2560 non-Hispanic whites (NHW) and non-Hispanic blacks (NHB) with colon cancer diagnosed from 1998 to 2007. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Logistic regression was used to assess the associations between race and the receipt of colon cancer surgery or chemotherapy while controlling for available potential confounders, both overall and stratified by age at diagnosis, sex, and tumor stage. RESULTS: After multivariate adjustment, the odds of receiving colon cancer surgery or chemotherapy for NHBs versus NHWs were similar (OR, 0.75 [95\% CI, 0.37-1.53]; OR, 0.79 [95\% CI, 0.59-1.04]). In addition, no effect modifications by age at diagnosis, sex, and tumor stage were observed. LIMITATIONS: Treatment data might not be complete for beneficiaries who also had non-Department of Defense health insurance. CONCLUSIONS: When access to medical care is equal, racial disparities in the provision of colon cancer surgery and chemotherapy were not apparent. Thus, it is possible that the inequalities in access to care play a major role in the racial disparities seen in colon cancer treatment in the general population.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Despite their importance to guiding public health decision-making and policies and to establishing programs aimed at improving surgical care, contemporary nationally representative mortality data for geriatric surgery are lacking. OBJECTIVE: To calculate population-based estimates of mortality after major surgery in community-living older US adults and to determine how these estimates differ according to key demographic, surgical, and geriatric characteristics. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective longitudinal cohort study with 1 year of follow-up in the continental US from 2011 to 2018. Participants included 5590 community-living fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries, aged 65 years or older, from the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS). Data analysis was conducted from February 22, 2021, to March 16, 2022. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Major surgeries and mortality over 1 year were identified through linkages with data from the Centers for Medicare \& Medicaid Services. Data on frailty and dementia were obtained from the annual NHATS assessments. RESULTS: From 2011 to 2017, of the 1193 major surgeries (from 992 community-living participants), the mean (SD) age was 79.2 (7.1) years; 665 were women (55.7\%), and 30 were Hispanic (2.5\%), 198 non-Hispanic Black (16.6\%), and 915 non-Hispanic White (76.7\%). Over the 1-year follow-up period, there were 206 deaths representing 872\,096 survey-weighted deaths and 13.4\% (95\% CI, 10.9\%-15.9\%) mortality. Mortality rates were 7.4\% (95\% CI, 4.9\%-9.9\%) for elective surgeries and 22.3\% (95\% CI, 17.4\%-27.1\%) for nonelective surgeries. For geriatric subgroups, 1-year mortality was 6.0\% (95\% CI, 2.6\%-9.4\%) for persons who were nonfrail, 27.8\% (95\% CI, 21.2\%-34.3\%) for those who were frail, 11.6\% (95\% CI, 8.8\%-14.4\%) for persons without dementia, and 32.7\% (95\% CI, 24.3\%-41.0\%) for those with probable dementia. The age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratios for 1-year mortality were 4.41 (95\% CI, 2.53-7.69) for frailty with a reduction in restricted mean survival time of 48.8 days and 2.18 (95\% CI, 1.40-3.40) for probable dementia with a reduction in restricted mean survival time of 44.9 days. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, the population-based estimate of 1-year mortality after major surgery among community-living older adults in the US was 13.4\% but was 3-fold higher for nonelective than elective procedures. Mortality was considerably elevated among older persons who were frail or who had probable dementia, highlighting the potential prognostic value of geriatric conditions after major surgery.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Although there have been meta-analyses of the effects of exercise-only prehabilitation on patients undergoing colorectal surgery, little is known about the effects of nutrition-only (oral nutritional supplements with and without counseling) and multimodal (oral nutritional supplements with and without counseling and with exercise) prehabilitation on clinical outcomes and patient function after surgery. We performed a systemic review and meta-analysis to determine the individual and combined effects of nutrition-only and multimodal prehabilitation compared with no prehabilitation (control) on outcomes of patients undergoing colorectal resection. METHODS: We searched Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, CENTRAL, and ProQuest for cohort and randomized controlled studies of adults awaiting colorectal surgery who received at least 7 days of nutrition prehabilitation with or without exercise. We performed a random-effects meta-analysis to estimate the pooled risk ratio for categorical data and the weighted mean difference for continuous variables. The primary outcome was length of hospital stay; the secondary outcome was recovery of functional capacity based on results of a 6-minute walk test. RESULTS: We identified 9 studies (5~randomized controlled studies and 4 cohort studies) composed of 914 patients undergoing colorectal surgery (438 received prehabilitation and 476 served as controls). Receipt of any prehabilitation significantly decreased days spent in the hospital compared with controls (weighted mean difference of length of hospital stay~=~-2.2 days; 95\% confidence interval~=~-3.5 to~-0.9). Only 3 studies reported on functional outcomes but could not be pooled owing to methodologic heterogeneity. In the individual studies, multimodal prehabilitation significantly improved results of the 6-minute walk test at 4 and 8 weeks after surgery compared with standard Enhanced Recovery Pathway care and at 8 weeks compared with standard Enhanced Recovery Pathway care with added rehabilitation. The 4 observational studies had a high risk of bias. CONCLUSIONS: In a systematic review and meta-analysis, we found that nutritional prehabilitation alone or combined with an exercise program significantly decreased length of hospital stay by 2 days in patients undergoing colorectal surgery. There is some evidence that multimodal prehabilitation accelerated the return to presurgical functional capacity.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The preoperative period (prehabilitation) may represent a more appropriate time than the postoperative period to implement an intervention. The impact of prehabilitation on recovery of function al exercise capacity was thus studied in patients undergoing colorectal resection for cancer. METHODS: A parallel-arm single-blind superiority randomized controlled trial was conducted. Seventy-seven patients were randomized to receive either prehabilitation (n = 38) or rehabilitation (n = 39). Both groups received a home-based intervention of moderate aerobic and resistance exercises, nutritional counseling with protein supplementation, and relaxation exercises initiated either 4 weeks before surgery (prehabilitation) or immediately after surgery (rehabilitation), and continued for 8 weeks after surgery. Patients were managed with an enhanced recovery pathway. Primary outcome was functional exercise capacity measured using the validated 6-min walk test. RESULTS: Median duration of prehabilitation was 24.5 days. While awaiting surgery, functional walking capacity increased ({$\geq$} 20 m) in a higher proportion of the prehabilitation group compared with the rehabilitation group (53 vs. 15\%, adjusted P = 0.006). Complication rates and duration of hospital stay were similar. The difference between baseline and 8-week 6-min walking test was significantly higher in the prehabilitation compared with the rehabilitation group (+23.7 m [SD, 54.8] vs. -21.8 m [SD, 80.7]; mean difference 45.4 m [95\% CI, 13.9 to 77.0]). A higher proportion of the prehabilitation group were also recovered to or above baseline exercise capacity at 8 weeks compared with the rehabilitation group (84 vs. 62\%, adjusted P = 0.049).

All patients had a palliative care consult any time between starting an immune checkpoint inhibitor and death. Univariate and multivariate models were used to examine variables related to immune checkpoint inhibitor use near the end of life.Results:Among 157 patients studied, 42 (27\%) received a dose of immune checkpoint inhibitor in the last 30 days of life. Those who received treatment in the last 30 days of life had lower hospice enrollment (19 [45\%] vs 78 [69\%], P = .007) and higher rates of dying in the hospital (23 [56\%] vs 33 [29\%], P = .002). The percentage of patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) {$\geq$}3 at the time of last immune checkpoint inhibitor dose was higher in the group that received immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment in the last 30 days of life (11 [26\%] vs 9 [8\%], P = .003).

Because of software upgrades and errors related to installation, clarifications and a revised tutorial were needed for calculating SM cross-sectional area (CSA) using the National Institutes of Health (NIH) ImageJ. METHODS: A pilot study was conducted to determine the usability of the tutorial version 2.0. Eight adults ({$\geq$}18 years of age) who had no previous experience or background in body composition or computed-tomography imaging and owned a personal laptop computer (Mac or PC) were included in the pilot study. Participants were tested on the completion of 4 tasks: (1) installation of software, (2) updating the software, (3) following revised tutorial (version 2.0), and (4) transferring information from the software to a spreadsheet for calculation of SM CSA. RESULTS: All participants completed the tutorial and all assigned tasks, 4/4 (100\%). However, 38\% (3/8) of the participants made errors while cutting and pasting values from the ImageJ results box to a spreadsheet for calculating SM CSA. CONCLUSION: The tutorial version 2.0 was easy to follow and provided sufficient information for adults to install, update, and perform the steps of body composition for the NIH ImageJ software without major issues. Care should be taken when cutting and pasting results from the software as well as when using the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet for calculating SM CSA.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Obesity, defined by body mass index (BMI), appears to have a paradoxical protective effect in several chronic diseases. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the obesity paradox in cancer patients by using body composition. DESIGN: The study was an observational study of 175 cancer patients assessed before chemotherapy. Obesity was defined as BMI (in kg/m(2)) {$\geq$}30 or fat mass index (FMI; fat mass divided by the square of height) {$\geq$}5.2 (men) and {$\geq$}8.2 (women) measured by using a bioelectrical impedance analysis. Low muscle mass (sarcopenia) was defined as fat-free mass index (fat-free mass divided by the square of height) {$<$}17.5 (men) and {$<$}15.1 (women). RESULTS: Most patients were women (65.7\%) and had a mean ({$\pm$}SD) age of 56.9 {$\pm$} 12.8 y. According to BMI criteria, 60\% of patients were overweight or obese. The median survival time for overweight (2.64 y; range: 0.23-3.16 y) and obese (2.61 y; range: 0.26-3.20 y) patients was significantly higher than for patients with a normal (2.04 y; range: 0.06-3.05 y) or low (0.52 y; range: 0.19-0.98 y) BMI (P {$<$} 0.001). Sarcopenic patients had shorter survival, regardless of their FMI. Obesity predicted higher survival rates only when sarcopenia was absent. In a multivariate Cox regression model, sarcopenia was an independent predictor of higher mortality (HR: 5.19; 95\% CI: 2.58, 10.43) after we controlled for BMI, age, and tumor stage. CONCLUSIONS: The obesity paradox is present in cancer patients only when obesity is defined by BMI. Patients with sarcopenic obesity had the poorest prognosis. Cancer patients with high mortality risk can be identified by a body-composition assessment.},

  abstract = {Computed tomography (CT) can yield quantitative imaging data from detailed maps of linear attenuation coefficients within tissue. The attenuation characteristics of skeletal muscle and adipose tissue can be quantified in vivo to provide information about the composition of skeletal muscle and the distribution of adipose tissue within muscle. Several studies have taken advantage of this utility to quantify skeletal muscle composition and fatty infiltration of muscle, in particular to quantify the attenuation characteristics of muscle as a marker of its lipid content. In this manner we found that the mean muscle attenuation of skeletal muscle reflects an increase in its fat content in obesity, and that this regional body composition parameter is strongly related to insulin-resistant glucose metabolism. In addition, muscle composition and adipose tissue distribution within muscle may be altered with clinical weight-loss interventions. CT may also provide important information about the changes in muscle mass and composition with aging and disease, which may, in turn, affect the muscle's function. In summary, CT can provide important quantitative data on the composition of muscle, and the distribution of adipose tissue within it, and this may be important in examining the relationships among skeletal muscle metabolism, lipid accumulation within muscle, and muscle function.},

METHODS: We developed recommendations for thromboprophylaxis in nonorthopedic surgical patients by using systematic methods as described in Methodology for the Development of Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis Guidelines. Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines in this supplement. RESULTS: We describe several alternatives for stratifying the risk of VTE in general and abdominal-pelvic surgical patients. When the risk for VTE is very low ({$<$} 0.5\%), we recommend that no specific pharmacologic (Grade 1B) or mechanical (Grade 2C) prophylaxis be used other than early ambulation. For patients at low risk for VTE ({$\sim$}1.5\%), we suggest mechanical prophylaxis, preferably with intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC), over no prophylaxis (Grade 2C). For patients at moderate risk for VTE ({$\sim$}3\%) who are not at high risk for major bleeding complications, we suggest low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) (Grade 2B), low-dose unfractionated heparin (Grade 2B), or mechanical prophylaxis with IPC (Grade 2C) over no prophylaxis. For patients at high risk for VTE ({$\sim$}6\%) who are not at high risk for major bleeding complications, we recommend pharmacologic prophylaxis with LMWH (Grade 1B) or low-dose unfractionated heparin (Grade 1B) over no prophylaxis. In these patients, we suggest adding mechanical prophylaxis with elastic stockings or IPC to pharmacologic prophylaxis (Grade 2C). For patients at high risk for VTE undergoing abdominal or pelvic surgery for cancer, we recommend extended-duration, postoperative, pharmacologic prophylaxis (4 weeks) with LMWH over limited-duration prophylaxis (Grade 1B). For patients at moderate to high risk for VTE who are at high risk for major bleeding complications or those in whom the consequences of bleeding are believed to be particularly severe, we suggest use of mechanical prophylaxis, preferably with IPC, over no prophylaxis until the risk of bleeding diminishes and pharmacologic prophylaxis may be initiated (Grade 2C). For patients in all risk groups, we suggest that an inferior vena cava filter not be used for primary VTE prevention (Grade 2C) and that surveillance with venous compression ultrasonography should not be performed (Grade 2C). We developed similar recommendations for other nonorthopedic surgical populations. CONCLUSIONS: Optimal thromboprophylaxis in nonorthopedic surgical patients will consider the risks of VTE and bleeding complications as well as the values and preferences of individual patients.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate a fully automated abdominal CT-based muscle tool in a large adult screening population. METHODS: A fully automated validated muscle segmentation algorithm was applied to 9310 non-contrast CT scans, including a primary screening cohort of 8037 consecutive asymptomatic adults (mean age, 57.1{$\pm$}7.8 years; 3555M/4482F). Sequential follow-up scans were available in a subset of 1171 individuals (mean interval, 5.1 years). Muscle tissue cross-sectional area and attenuation (Hounsfield unit, HU) at the L3 level were assessed, including change over time. RESULTS: Mean values were significantly higher in males for both muscle area (190.6{$\pm$}33.6 vs 133.3{$\pm$}24.1 cm2, p{$<$}0.001) and density (34.3{$\pm$}11.1 HU vs 27.3{$\pm$}11.7 HU, p{$<$}0.001). Age-related losses were observed, with mean muscle area reduction of -1.5 cm2/year and attenuation reduction of -1.5 HU/year. Overall age-related muscle density (attenuation) loss was steeper than for muscle area for both sexes up to the age of 70 years. Between ages 50 and 70, relative muscle attenuation decreased significantly more in females (-30.6\% vs -18.0\%, p{$<$}0.001), whereas relative rates of muscle area loss were similar (-8\%). Between ages 70 and 90, males lost more density (-22.4\% vs -7.5\%) and area (-13.4\% vs -6.9\%, p{$<$}0.001). Of the 1171 patients with longitudinal follow-up, 1013 (86.5\%) showed a decrease in muscle attenuation, 739 (63.1\%) showed a decrease in area, and 1119 (95.6\%) showed a decrease in at least one of these measures. CONCLUSION: This fully automated CT muscle tool allows for both individualized and population-based assessment. Such data could be automatically derived at abdominal CT regardless of study indication, allowing for opportunistic sarcopenia detection. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: This fully automated tool can be applied to routine abdominal CT scans for prospective or retrospective opportunistic sarcopenia assessment, regardless of the original clinical indication. Mean values were significantly higher in males for both muscle area and muscle density. Overall age-related muscle density (attenuation) loss was steeper than for muscle area for both sexes, and therefore may be a more valuable predictor of adverse outcomes.},

The aim of this study is to investigate whether sarcopenia is associated with postoperative short-term outcome (morbidity and mortality) and long-term survival in patients undergoing esophagectomy for cancer after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. METHODS: All patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by esophagectomy for cancer, and of whom an adequate CT scan was available, were included in the current study. The presence of sarcopenia was defined by CT imaging using cut-off values of the total cross-sectional muscle tissue measured transversely at the third lumbar level. RESULTS: A total number of 120 patients were eligible for analysis. Almost half of the patients (N~=~54, 45~\%) were classified as having sarcopenia; 24 sarcopenic patients (44~\%) had overweight and 5 sarcopenic patients (9~\%) were obese. Overall morbidity and mortality rate did not differ significantly between sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic patients, nor did long-term overall or disease-free survival. Also sarcopenic obesity was not associated with worse outcome. CONCLUSION: The presence of sarcopenia was not associated with a negative short- and long-term outcome in this selected group of esophageal cancer patients after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by esophagectomy.},

However, the influence of BMI and BMI loss on people with esophageal cancer that were treated with different therapies has not been described in China. Methods: In total, 615 consecutive patients that underwent esophagectomy and/or chemotherapy/radiotherapy were classified according to the Asian-specific BMI (kg/m2) cutoff values. The impact of BMI and BMI loss on long-term overall survival (OS) was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard models. Results: Multivariate analysis showed that overweight and obese patients had a more favorable survival than normal weight and underweight patients (p=0.017). Patients with a low BMI and high BMI loss before therapy had worse OS than others (p=0.001). Subgroup analysis showed that patients with a high BMI were more likely to suffer hypertension (p{$<$}0.001) and receive only surgery (p{$<$}0.001), and they were less likely to be smokers (p=0.007) and anemic (p{$<$}0.001). Conversely, patients with high BMI loss were more likely to be anemic (p=0.001), to have advanced pathological stage (p=0.012), and to receive chemotherapy and radiotherapy (p=0.001). Moreover, the mortality rate was higher when patients had a high BMI loss. There is no survival benefit of higher BMI in the non-esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) group. Conclusion: Pretreatment BMI was an independent prognostic factor for long-term survival in esophageal cancer patients treated with different treatments. The overall survival was increased in esophageal cancer patients with a high pretreatment BMI and no BMI loss. There is no survival benefit of higher BMI in the non-ESCC group.},

  abstract = {Background: An objective measure is needed to identify frail older adults with cancer who are at increased risk for poor health outcomes. The primary objective of this study was to develop a frailty index from a cancer-specific geriatric assessment (GA) and evaluate its ability to predict all-cause mortality among older adults with cancer. Patients and Methods: Using a unique and novel data set that brings together GA data with cancer-specific and long-term mortality data, we developed the Carolina Frailty Index (CFI) from a cancer-specific GA based on the principles of deficit accumulation. CFI scores (range, 0-1) were categorized as robust (0-0.2), pre-frail (0.2-0.35), and frail ({$>$}0.35). The primary outcome for evaluating predictive validity was all-cause mortality. The Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank tests were used to compare survival between frailty groups, and Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to evaluate associations. Results: In our sample of 546 older adults with cancer, the median age was 72 years, 72\% were women, 85\% were white, and 47\% had a breast cancer diagnosis. Overall, 58\% of patients were robust, 24\% were pre-frail, and 18\% were frail. The estimated 5-year survival rate was 72\% in robust patients, 58\% in pre-frail patients, and 34\% in frail patients (log-rank test, P{$<$}.0001). Frail patients had more than a 2-fold increased risk of all-cause mortality compared with robust patients (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.36; 95\% CI, 1.51-3.68). Conclusions: The CFI was predictive of all-cause mortality in older adults with cancer, a finding that was independent of age, sex, cancer type and stage, and number of medical comorbidities. The CFI has the potential to become a tool that oncologists can use to objectively identify frailty in older adults with cancer.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to characterize utilization and survival outcomes associated with primary tumor-directed radiotherapy (PTDRT) in patients with newly diagnosed metastatic esophageal cancer. METHODS: We conducted an observational cohort study using the National Cancer Data Base to evaluate patients with newly diagnosed metastatic esophageal cancer between 2004 and 2012. Overall survival outcomes after treatment with chemotherapy plus conventional palliative dose radiotherapy ({$<$}5040 cGy), chemotherapy plus definitive dose radiotherapy ({$\geq$}5040 cGy), or chemotherapy alone were compared by using Cox proportional hazards models with inverse probability of treatment weighting using the propensity score. Potential unmeasured confounding was assessed through sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The final cohort consisted of 12,683 patients: 57\% were treated with chemotherapy alone, 24\% were treated with chemotherapy plus palliative dose radiotherapy, and 19\% were treated with chemotherapy plus definitive dose radiotherapy. Compared with chemotherapy alone, chemotherapy plus definitive dose radiotherapy was associated with improved survival (median overall survival of 8.3 versus 11.3 months [hazard ratio~= 0.72, 95\% confidence interval: 0.70-0.74, p {$\leq$} 0.001]), whereas chemotherapy plus palliative dose radiotherapy was associated with slightly inferior outcomes (median overall survival of 8.3 months versus 7.5 months (hazard ratio~= 1.10, 95\% confidence interval 1.07-1.13, p {$\leq$} 0.001). These findings were robust to potential unmeasured confounding in sensitivity analyses. Additionally, landmark analyses confirmed these findings in patients surviving 12 months or longer. CONCLUSIONS: Definitive dose, but not conventional palliative dose, PTDRT is associated with improved overall survival in metastatic esophageal cancer, suggesting that local control may be important to prognosis. These findings support integrating PTDRT into future clinical trials aimed at refining personalized treatment for patients with metastatic esophageal cancer.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Patients with Barrett's esophagus (BE) and high-grade dysplasia (HGD) or early neoplasia increasingly receive endoscopic mucosal resection and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) therapy. We analyzed data from a UK registry that follows the outcomes of patients with BE who have undergone RFA for neoplasia. METHODS: We collected data on 335 patients with BE and neoplasia (72\% with HGD, 24\% with intramucosal cancer, 4\% with low-grade dysplasia [mean age, 69 years; 81\% male]), treated at 19 centers in the United Kingdom from July 2008 through August 2012. Mean length of BE segments was 5.8 cm (range, 1-20 cm). Patients' nodules were removed by endoscopic mucosal resection, and the patients then underwent RFA every 3 months until all areas of BE were ablated or cancer developed. Biopsies were collected 12 months after the first RFA; clearance of HGD, dysplasia, and BE were assessed. RESULTS: HGD was cleared from 86\% of patients, all dysplasia from 81\%, and BE from 62\% at the 12-month time point, after a mean of 2.5 (range, 2-6) RFA procedures. Complete reversal dysplasia was 15\% less likely for every 1-cm increment in BE length (odds ratio~= 1.156; SE~= 0.048; 95\% confidence interval: 1.07-1.26; P {$<$} .001). Endoscopic mucosal resection before RFA did not provide any benefit. Invasive cancer developed in 10 patients (3\%) by the 12-month time point and disease had progressed in 17 patients (5.1\%) after a median follow-up time of 19 months. Symptomatic strictures developed in 9\% of patients and were treated by endoscopic dilatation. Nineteen months after therapy began, 94\% of patients remained clear of dysplasia. CONCLUSIONS: We analyzed data from a large series of patients in the United Kingdom who underwent RFA for BE-related neoplasia and found that by 12 months after treatment, dysplasia was cleared from 81\%. Shorter segments of BE respond better to RFA; http://www.controlled-trials.com, number ISRCTN93069556.},

  abstract = {Perioperative anemia is common, yet detrimental, in surgical patients. However, red blood cell transfusions (RBCTs) used to treat anemia are associated with significant postoperative risks and worse oncologic outcomes. Perioperative iron has been suggested to mitigate perioperative anemia. This meta-analysis examined the impact of perioperative iron compared to no intervention on the need for RBCT in gastrointestinal surgery. We systematically searched Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Central, and Scopus to identify relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and nonrandomized studies (NRSs). We excluded studies investigating autologous RBCT or erythropoietin. Two independent reviewers selected the studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane tool and Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Primary outcomes were proportion of patients getting allogeneic RBCT and number of transfused patient. Secondary outcomes were hemoglobin change, 30-day postoperative morbidity and mortality, length of stay, and oncologic outcomes. A meta-analysis using random effects models was performed. The review was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42013004805). From 883 citations, we included 2 RCTs and 2 NRSs (n = 325 patients), all pertaining to colorectal cancer surgery. Randomized controlled trials were at high risk for bias and underpowered. One RCT and 1 NRS using preoperative oral iron reported a decreased proportion of patients needing RBCT. One RCT on preoperative intravenous iron and 1 NRS on postoperative PO iron did not observe a difference. Only 1 study revealed a difference in number of transfused patients. One RCT reported significantly increased postintervention hemoglobin. Among 3 studies reporting length of stay, none observed a difference. Other secondary outcomes were not reported. Meta-analysis revealed a trend toward fewer patients requiring RBCT with iron supplementation (risk ratio, 0.66 [0.42, 1.02]), but no benefit on the number of RBCT per patient (weighted mean difference, -0.91 [-1.61, -0.18]). Although preliminary evidence suggests that it may be a promising strategy, there is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of perioperative iron to decrease the need for RBCT in colorectal cancer surgery. Well-designed RCTs focusing on the need for RBCT and including long-term outcomes are warranted.},

This retrospective study investigates the relationship between sarcopenia and clinical outcome in ESCC patients treated by surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation therapy (dCRT). The study was retrospectively conducted in a single academic hospital in Kumamoto, Japan, and involved 325 ESCC patients (256 surgical cases and 69 dCRT cases) treated between April 2005 and April 2011. Skeletal muscle mass was quantified by radiologic measures using standard computed tomography scans. The skeletal muscle tissue in the 325 ESCC patients was distributed as follows: mean: 47.10; median: 46.88; standard deviation (SD): 7.39; range: 31.48\textendash 71.11; interquartile range, 46.29\textendash 47.90. Skeletal muscle tissue was greater in male patients than in female patients (P {$<$} 0.0001), but was independent of other clinical and tumor features. Sarcopenia was not significantly associated with overall survival (log rank P = 0.54). Lymph node involvement significantly altered the relationship between sarcopenia and survival rate (P for interaction = 0.026). Sarcopenia significantly reduced the overall survival of patients without lymph node involvement (log rank P = 0.035), but was uncorrelated with overall survival in patients with lymph involvement (log rank, P = 0.31). The anastomosis leakage rate was significantly higher in the sarcopenia group than in the non-sarcopenia group (P = 0.032), but other surgical complications did not significantly differ between the two groups. Sarcopenia in ESCC patients without lymph node involvement is associated with poor prognosis, indicating sarcopenia as a potential biomarker for identifying patients likely to experience an inferior outcome. Moreover, sarcopenia was associated with anastomosis leakage but no other short-term surgical outcome.},

We reviewed our institutional experience over 21~years (1990-2011) to determine clinical staging accuracy, optimal treatment approaches, and factors predictive of survival in this patient population. METHODS: Patients with cT2N0M0 esophageal cancer determined by endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) were identified through a prospectively collected database. Demographics, perioperative data, and outcomes were examined. Cox regression model and Kaplan-Meier plots were used for statistical survival analysis. RESULTS: A total of 731 patients underwent esophagectomy, of whom 68 cT2N0M0 patients (9~\%) were identified. Fifty-seven patients (84~\%) had adenocarcinoma. Thirty-three patients (48.5~\%) were treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery, and 35 underwent surgical resection alone. All resections except one included a transthoracic approach with two-field lymph node dissection. Thirty-day operative mortality was 2.9~\%. Only 3 patients (8.5~\%) who underwent surgery alone had T2N0M0 disease identified by pathology: the disease of 15 (42.8~\%) was found to be overstaged and 17 (48.5~\%) understaged after surgery. Understaging was more common in poorly differentiated tumors (p~=~0.03). Nine patients (27.2~\%) had complete pathologic response after chemoradiotherapy. Absence of lymph node metastases (pN0) was significantly more frequent in the neoadjuvant group (29 of 33 vs. 21 of 35, p~=~0.01). Median follow-up was 44.2~months. Overall 5-year survival was 50.8~\%. On multivariate analysis, adenocarcinoma (p~=~0.001) and pN0 after resection (p~=~0.01) were significant predictors of survival. CONCLUSIONS: EUS was inaccurate in staging cT2N0M0 esophageal cancer in this study. Poorly differentiated tumors were more frequently understaged. Adenocarcinoma and absence of lymph node metastases (pN0) were independently predictive of long-term survival. pN0 status was significantly more common in patients undergoing neoadjuvant therapy, but long-term survival was not affected by neoadjuvant therapy. A strategy of neoadjuvant therapy followed by resection may be optimal in this group, especially in patients with disease likely to be understaged.},

  abstract = {Multivariable regression models are powerful tools that are used frequently in studies of clinical outcomes. These models can use a mixture of categorical and continuous variables and can handle partially observed (censored) responses. However, uncritical application of modelling techniques can result in models that poorly fit the dataset at hand, or, even more likely, inaccurately predict outcomes on new subjects. One must know how to measure qualities of a model's fit in order to avoid poorly fitted or overfitted models. Measurement of predictive accuracy can be difficult for survival time data in the presence of censoring. We discuss an easily interpretable index of predictive discrimination as well as methods for assessing calibration of predicted survival probabilities. Both types of predictive accuracy should be unbiasedly validated using bootstrapping or cross-validation, before using predictions in a new data series. We discuss some of the hazards of poorly fitted and overfitted regression models and present one modelling strategy that avoids many of the problems discussed. The methods described are applicable to all regression models, but are particularly needed for binary, ordinal, and time-to-event outcomes. Methods are illustrated with a survival analysis in prostate cancer using Cox regression.},

Chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery (trimodality therapy) has not been widely adopted. The outcomes of patients undergoing dCRT or trimodality therapy at our cancer center between 2004 and 2012 were restrospectively analyzed. Trimodality therapy was offered to selected patients of good performance status (World Health Organisation performance status 0/1), with squamous cell carcinoma or bulky adenocarcinoma. dCRT was offered to patients of good PS but with comorbidities, upper third tumors or at patient's request. Patients received four cycles of chemotherapy with a platinum agent (mostly cisplatin) and a fluoropyrimidine (mostly 5-fluorouracil) over a total of 11 weeks. Cycles 3 and 4 were given concurrently with radiotherapy: 50 Gy in 25 fractions for dCRT and 45 Gy in 25 fractions in the trimodality group. Surgery occurred 8-10 weeks following the completion of chemoradiotherapy. The cut-off length for maximum gross tumor volume length was 10 cm. One hundred two patients were included (47 received dCRT, and 55 received trimodality treatment). The majority of tumors were stage III (80.4\%), and two-thirds were located in the distal esophagus (64.7\%). Median follow-up was 44 months. The 2-year overall survival (OS) was 57.3\% (median OS 39.7 months) for the dCRT group and 77.8\% (median not reached) for the trimodality group. The 5-year OS rates were 38\% and 58\%, respectively. Postoperative mortality rate was low at 1.8\%, and the pathological complete response rate was 23.6\%. In conclusion, trimodality treatment for patients with esophageal and junctional gastroesophageal tumors offers high rates of 2-year survival, and the potential for long-term cure. dCRT is an established alternative for patients that are not fit or suitable for surgery.},

SMD and SMI were obtained from CT-based analysis using Slice-O-Matic\textregistered{} medical imaging software in patients who received S-1 plus cisplatin chemotherapy for metastatic gastric cancer. The CT images taken within 1 month before starting chemotherapy were used. The cut-off values for determining low SMD [{$<$}33 Hounsfield units (HU) in obese and {$<$}41 HU in non-obese patients] and low SMI ({$<$}41 cm2/m2 in females, {$<$}43 cm2/m2 in non-obese males and {$<$}53 cm2/m2 in obese males) were referenced from a large population based study.

Patients with low SMD had significantly shorter OS compared with patients having normal SMD (8.9 vs. 12.8 months, P=0.03). However, OS did not differ significantly between patients with low and normal SMI (11.1 and 14.3 months, P= 0.18). Multivariate analyses confirmed that low SMD was an independent predictor of poor outcomes (P{$<$}0.01).

In this study, aiming at solving the problem of low segmentation accuracy of the original 3D U-Net network, an improved network based on the three-dimensional (3D) U-Net, is proposed. Moreover, in order to solve the problem of insufficient training data caused by the difficulty of acquiring labeled 3D data, an improved 3D U-Net network is embedded into the framework of generative adversarial networks (GAN), which establishes a semi-supervised 3D liver segmentation optimization algorithm. Finally, considering the problem of poor quality of 3D abdominal fake images generated by utilizing random noise as input, deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) based on feature restoration method is designed to generate more realistic fake images. By testing the proposed algorithm on the LiTS-2017 and KiTS19 dataset, experimental results show that the proposed semi-supervised 3D liver segmentation method can greatly improve the segmentation performance of liver, with a Dice score of 0.9424 outperforming other methods.},

The performance of lower anterior resections has limited the rate of abdominoperineal excision with permanent colostomy to 11\%. Of 115 patients in whom curative resection was attempted, 69 had anastomoses below 5 cm and 39 had mural resection margins of less than 2.5 cm. Surgical priority, however, was given to complete excision of the visceral rectal mesentery or mesorectum. At an average of 4.2 years postoperatively, three pelvic recurrences have developed but there have been no staple-line recurrences in patients who had "curative" surgery. The corrected cumulative probability of survival at 5 years is 87\% and the tumour-free survival by Dukes stage is A 94\%, B 87\%, and C 58\%. Patients with low tumours did no less well than those with high tumours, when treated by anterior resection. On this evidence, it is often safe to limit mural clearance and thus preserve the anal sphincters, provided that the mesorectum is excised intact with the cancer.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To develop a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to automatically segment an axial CT image of the pelvis for body composition measures. We hypothesized that a deep CNN approach would achieve high accuracy when compared to manual segmentations as the reference standard. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We manually segmented 200 axial CT images at the supra-acetabular level in 200 subjects, labeling background, subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), muscle, inter-muscular adipose tissue (IMAT), bone, and miscellaneous intra-pelvic content. The dataset was randomly divided into training (180/200) and test (20/200) datasets. Data augmentation was utilized to enlarge the training dataset and all images underwent preprocessing with histogram equalization. Our model was trained for 50 epochs using the U-Net architecture with batch size of 8, learning rate of 0.0001, Adadelta optimizer and a dropout of 0.20. The Dice (F1) score was used to assess similarity between the manual segmentations and the CNN predicted segmentations. RESULTS: The CNN model with data augmentation of N\,=\,3000 achieved accurate segmentation of body composition for all classes. The Dice scores were as follows: background (1.00), miscellaneous intra-pelvic content (0.98), SAT (0.97), muscle (0.95), IMAT (0.91), and bone (0.92). Mean time to automatically segment one CT image was 0.07~s (GPU) and 2.51~s (CPU). CONCLUSIONS: Our CNN-based model enables accurate automated segmentation of multiple tissues on pelvic CT images, with promising implications for body composition studies.},

Design: A prospective cohort study. Background: nCRT is increasingly standard of care in LAEC, with pCR a surrogate for excellent outcome. Predicting pCR before surgery, with metabolic imaging and endoscopy, may spare patients' operative intervention. Methods: One hundred thirty-eight consecutive patients [mean age 61 \AE{} 8, 99 male (72\%), 103 (75\%) adenocarcinoma] underwent nCRT with CT-PET and endoscopy 4 to 6 weeks later, and surgery subsequently. A complete metabolic response (cMR) was defined as SUVmax of {$<$}4. A complete endoscopic response (cER) was no residual mucosal abnormality. The association of pCR with cMR and cER was analyzed. Results: pCR was achieved in 30 patients (22\%); 37\% SCC and 17\% adenocarcinoma. A cMR was evident in 63 (46\%), of whom 17 (27\%) had a pCR and 17(27\%) were ypN\th. A cER was observed in 45 (33\%). The Spearman correlation for cER and cMR was 0.066 (P {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.479), for cER and pCR was 0.004 (P {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.969), and cMR and pCR \textendash 0.120 (P {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.160). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of cMR was 57\%, 57\%, 27\%, and 82\%, respectively, and for combined cMR and cER was 24\%, 83\%, 28\%, and 79\%, respectively. Conclusions: The prediction of pCR through CT-PET and endoscopy independently or combined is limited by low sensitivity and poor positive predictive value. Protocols to avoid surgery in patients with apparent complete clinical complete based on these criteria should be adopted with considerable caution.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Delay in the diagnosis of breast cancer is associated with worse stage distribution at diagnosis and decreased survival. However, the occurrence of delay in the delivery of adjuvant therapy and its impact on prognosis is not well understood. METHODS: To investigate the timeliness of initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy following surgery for breast cancer, we used data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End-Results (SEER)-Medicare database. Among women {$>$} or = 65 years diagnosed between 1992 and 1999 with stages I-II breast cancer, we used linear regression and Cox proportional hazards models to investigate the time intervals between surgery and initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy, factors associated with delay, and the effect of delay on survival. RESULTS: Our sample consisted of 5003 women who received adjuvant chemotherapy. Of these, 47\% initiated chemotherapy within 1 month, 37\% between 1 and 2 months, 6\% between 2 and 3 months and 10\% {$>$}3 months (delay) following surgery. Delay was associated with increasing age, residing in a rural location, being unmarried, earlier tumor stage, hormone receptor positivity, mastectomy, and non-receipt of radiation therapy. Survival did not differ among patients who initiated chemotherapy within 1, 2, or 3 months after surgery. Delay beyond 3 months was, however, associated with increased disease-specific mortality (HR 1.69; 95\% CI 1.31-2.19) and overall mortality (HR 1.46; 95\% CI 1.21-1.75). CONCLUSIONS: Among older patients, moderate delays in the receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy occur frequently, but long delays ({$>$}3 months) are uncommon. While early initiation of therapy is no benefit, significant delays are associated with increased mortality. Whether this reflects the medical impact of the delay of chemotherapy or factors associated with delay is unclear, but until this is clarified, patients should be encouraged to initiate treatment without significant delay.},

However, head-to-head comparisons of neoadjuvant chemoradiation and perioperative chemotherapy applying contemporary treatment protocols are lacking. The present trial was initiated to obtain valid information whether neoadjuvant chemoradiation or perioperative chemotherapy yields better survival in the treatment of localized esophageal adenocarcinoma. METHODS/DESIGN: The ESOPEC trial is an investigator-initiated multicenter prospective randomized controlled two-arm trial, comparing the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemoradiation (CROSS protocol: 41.4Gy plus carboplatin/paclitaxel) followed by surgery versus perioperative chemotherapy and surgery (FLOT protocol: 5-FU/leucovorin/oxaliplatin/docetaxel) for the curative treatment of localized esophageal adenocarcinoma. Patients with cT1cN\,+\,cM0 and cT2-4acNxcM0 esophageal and junctional adenocarcinoma are eligible. The trial aims to include 438 participants who are centrally randomized to one of the two treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio stratified by N-stage and study site. The primary endpoint of the trial is overall survival assessed with a minimum follow-up of 36~months. Secondary objectives are progression-free survival, recurrence-free survival, site of failure, postoperative morbidity and mortality, duration of hospitalization as well as quality of life. DISCUSSION: The ESOPEC trial compares perioperative chemotherapy according to the FLOT protocol to neoadjuvant chemoradiation according to the CROSS protocol in multimodal treatment of non-metastasized recectable adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and the gastroesophageal junction. The goal of the trial is identify the superior protocol with regard to patient survival, treatment morbidity and quality of life. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT02509286 (July 22, 2015).},

METHODS: Tumor lengths were examined retrospectively for 389 esophagectomy patients with respect to Endoscopy, EUS (Endoscopic Ultrasound), CT and PET-CT, and pathology. Correlations between the measurements on the different approaches were assessed, and associations between tumor length and survival were analyzed. RESULTS: Only the tumor lengths assessed on pathology were found to be significantly associated with overall (P\,=\,0.001) and recurrence free (P\,{$<$}\,0.001) survival on univariable analysis. The median overall survival was 47.1 months in those patients with tumor lengths {$<$}3.0\,cm, falling to 19.6 and 18.0 months in those with 3.0-4.4 and 4.5+\,cm tumors, respectively, demonstrating a reduction in patient survival at a tumor length of around 3\,cm. Tumor length on pathology was significantly correlated with tumor differentiation and both T- and N-categories. After accounting for these factors, tumor length on pathology was a significant independent predictor of recurrence-free (P\,=\,0.016), but not overall (P\,=\,0.128) survival. CONCLUSIONS: Tumor lengths on pathology were found to be the most predictive of patient outcome.

DESIGN: Systematic review with meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses of randomised clinical trials. DATA SOURCES: Cochrane central register of controlled trials, SilverPlatter Medline (1950 to date), SilverPlatter Embase (1980 to date), and Science Citation Index Expanded (1900 to present). Reference lists of identified trials and other systematic reviews were assessed, and authors and experts in transfusion were contacted to identify additional trials. TRIAL SELECTION: Published and unpublished randomised clinical trials that evaluated a restrictive compared with a liberal transfusion strategy in adults or children, irrespective of language, blinding procedure, publication status, or sample size. DATA EXTRACTION: Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts of trials identified, and relevant trials were evaluated in full text for eligibility. Two reviewers then independently extracted data on methods, interventions, outcomes, and risk of bias from included trials. random effects models were used to estimate risk ratios and mean differences with 95\% confidence intervals. RESULTS: 31 trials totalling 9813 randomised patients were included. The proportion of patients receiving red blood cells (relative risk 0.54, 95\% confidence interval 0.47 to 0.63, 8923 patients, 24 trials) and the number of red blood cell units transfused (mean difference -1.43, 95\% confidence interval -2.01 to -0.86) were lower with the restrictive compared with liberal transfusion strategies. Restrictive compared with liberal transfusion strategies were not associated with risk of death (0.86, 0.74 to 1.01, 5707 patients, nine lower risk of bias trials), overall morbidity (0.98, 0.85 to 1.12, 4517 patients, six lower risk of bias trials), or fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction (1.28, 0.66 to 2.49, 4730 patients, seven lower risk of bias trials). Results were not affected by the inclusion of trials with unclear or high risk of bias. Using trial sequential analyses on mortality and myocardial infarction, the required information size was not reached, but a 15\% relative risk reduction or increase in overall morbidity with restrictive transfusion strategies could be excluded. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with liberal strategies, restrictive transfusion strategies were associated with a reduction in the number of red blood cell units transfused and number of patients being transfused, but mortality, overall morbidity, and myocardial infarction seemed to be unaltered. Restrictive transfusion strategies are safe in most clinical settings. Liberal transfusion strategies have not been shown to convey any benefit to patients.

Overall, median progression-free survival and median survival time were 9.3 and 26.7 months, respectively. The median survival time was 27.5 months in the group treated with surgery with perioperative treatment, 50.6 months in those treated with surgery alone, and 22 months in the dCRT group.

Sarcopenia, myosteatosis, and visceral obesity (VO) have been identified as predictive of survival in colorectal cancer (CRC). We performed a systematic review of contemporary studies to characterize this association and highlight methodological inconsistencies. METHODS: MEDLINE and PubMed were queried for articles published from January 2000 on, with populations of resectable CRC and with CT-measured body composition and survival data. The study quality was assessed by two independent reviewers using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. RESULTS: Twenty studies met inclusion criteria, with a total of 8895 patients. Only two of the studies scored as high quality and nine as moderate quality. The remaining nine studies scored as low quality. Ten studies considered sarcopenia and 12 considered visceral obesity (VO). Cutoff points to define sarcopenia, myosteatosis, and VO were identified by optimal stratification, quartiles, or median values. The prevalence of sarcopenia varied from 15 to 60\%, which based on study population and cutoff value used. Sarcopenia was associated with worse overall and disease-free survival in eight of the included studies. Myosteatosis was considered in three studies with a prevalence of 19-78\%. It was significantly predictive of worse overall and disease-free survival in all three studies. VO had a prevalence of 14-70\% and was inconsistently predictive of survival outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: There is a lack of methodological consistency within the currently published literature. Despite this, sarcopenia and myosteatosis, but not VO, are consistently associated with worse survival outcomes, when population and cancer-specific cutoffs are utilized.},

Using a context-specific approach (according to patient characteristics and clinical settings), the authors conducted a systematic review to quantify the effects of transfusion strategies. METHODS: The authors searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and grey literature sources to November 2015 for randomized controlled trials comparing restrictive versus liberal transfusion strategies applied more than 24\,h in adult surgical or critically ill patients. Data were independently extracted. Risk ratios were calculated for 30-day complications, defined as inadequate oxygen supply (myocardial, cerebral, renal, mesenteric, and peripheral ischemic injury; arrhythmia; and unstable angina), mortality, composite of both, and infections. Statistical combination followed a context-specific approach. Additional analyses explored transfusion protocol heterogeneity and cointerventions effects. RESULTS: Thirty-one trials were regrouped into five context-specific risk strata. In patients undergoing cardiac/vascular procedures, restrictive strategies seemed to increase the risk of events reflecting inadequate oxygen supply (risk ratio [RR], 1.09; 95\% CI, 0.97 to 1.22), mortality (RR, 1.39; 95\% CI, 0.95 to 2.04), and composite events (RR, 1.12; 95\% CI, 1.01 to 1.24-3322, 3245, and 3322 patients, respectively). Similar results were found in elderly orthopedic patients (inadequate oxygen supply: RR, 1.41; 95\% CI, 1.03 to 1.92; mortality: RR, 1.09; 95\% CI, 0.80 to 1.49; composite outcome: RR, 1.24; 95\% CI, 1.00 to 1.54-3465, 3546, and 3749 patients, respectively), but not in critically ill patients. No difference was found for infections, although a protective effect may exist. Risk estimates varied with successful/unsuccessful transfusion protocol implementation. CONCLUSIONS: Restrictive transfusion strategies should be applied with caution in high-risk patients undergoing major surgery.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous studies suggest an association between obesity and oesophageal (OA) and oesophagogastric junction adenocarcinomas (OGJA). However, these studies have been limited in their ability to assess whether the effects of obesity vary by gender or by the presence of gastro-oesophageal reflux (GERD) symptoms. METHODS: Individual participant data from 12 epidemiological studies (8 North American, 3 European and 1 Australian) comprising 1997 OA cases, 1900 OGJA cases and 11 159 control subjects were pooled. Logistic regression was used to estimate study-specific odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between body mass index (BMI, kg/m(2)) and the risk of OA and OGJA. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to combine these ORs. We also investigated effect modification and synergistic interaction of BMI with GERD symptoms and gender. RESULTS: The association of OA and OGJA increased directly with increasing BMI (P for trend {$<$}0.001). Compared with individuals with a BMI {$<$}25, BMI {$\geq$}40 was associated with both OA (OR 4.76, 95\% CI 2.96-7.66) and OGJA (OR 3.07, 95\% CI 1.89-4.99). These associations were similar when stratified by gender and GERD symptoms. There was evidence for synergistic interaction between BMI and GERD symptoms in relation to OA/OGJA risk. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that BMI is directly associated with OA and OGJA risk in both men and women and in those with and without GERD symptoms. Disentangling the relationship between BMI and GERD will be important for understanding preventive efforts for OA and OGJA.},

However, the initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy is just the first step for survival improvement. Little is known about the actual completion rate of such a therapy in the community. The objectives of this study were to measure the initiation and completion rate of adjuvant chemotherapy and to identify the associated factors. We studied 12,265 patients aged 65+ diagnosed with stage-III colon cancer between 1991 and 2005 who were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare linked database. Chemotherapy initiation was defined as at least one claim indicating the use of chemotherapy. The first and last claims were used to measure the length of chemotherapy. A complete course of chemotherapy was defined as 8-13~months for 1991-1995 cohort and 5-7~months for 1996-2005 cohort according to clinical guideline. Of the 12,265 patients, 64.4\% received adjuvant chemotherapy within 3~months after tumor resection. Among those who had chemotherapy initiated, 62.2\% (or 38.0\% of 12,265 patients) received a complete course of chemotherapy. Patient's age at diagnosis, marital status, and comorbidity score were the significant predictors for chemotherapy initiation. These variables remained significant in predicting chemotherapy completion after adjusting for year of diagnosis and other factors. In conclusion, initiation and completion of chemotherapy was largely influenced by patient's age, marital status and comorbidity. Further investigation is needed to explore the cause of these differences in adherence to standard treatment that is essential for better quality of cancer care.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: PD-1 blockade is highly effective in patients with mismatch repair-deficient or microsatellite instability-high metastatic colorectal cancer. The role of single-agent PD-1 blockade in the neoadjuvant setting for resectable mismatch repair-deficient or microsatellite instability-high colorectal cancer remains unclear. We investigated the efficacy and safety of PD-1 blockade with toripalimab, with or without the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib, as neoadjuvant treatment for mismatch repair-deficient or microsatellite instability-high, locally advanced, colorectal cancers. METHODS: The PD-1 Inhibitor in Microsatellite Instability Colorectal Cancer (PICC) trial was a single-centre, open-label, parallel-group, non-comparative, randomised, phase 2 study undertaken at the Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University (Guangzhou, China). Eligible patients were aged 18-75 years, had histologically confirmed mismatch repair-deficient or microsatellite instability-high colorectal cancer, had clinical stage T3-T4 or any T with lymph node positivity (N+), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score of 0 or 1, and adequate haematological, hepatic, and renal function. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1), without any stratification or balanced blocking, to receive toripalimab 3 mg/kg intravenously on day 1, with or without celecoxib 200 mg orally twice daily from day 1 to 14 of each 14-day cycle, for six cycles before surgical resection. Adjuvant treatment with toripalimab with or without celecoxib was permitted at the investigators' discretion. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with pathological complete response, defined as tumours without any viable tumour cells in the resected primary tumour sample and all sampled regional lymph nodes. All efficacy and safety analyses were assessed in the modified intention-to-treat population, which included all patients who were randomly assigned to treatment and who received at least one dose of toripalimab. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03926338, and is ongoing. FINDINGS: Between May 1, 2019, and April 1, 2021, 53 patients were screened, of whom 34 were randomly assigned to either the toripalimab plus celecoxib group (n=17) or the toripalimab monotherapy group (n=17). As of data cutoff (Aug 10, 2021), median follow-up was 14{$\cdot$}9 months (IQR 8{$\cdot$}8-17{$\cdot$}0). All patients received study treatment and underwent surgical resection; there were no treatment-related surgical delays. All 34 patients had an R0 resection ({$>$}1 mm resection margin). 15 of 17 patients (88\% [95\% CI 64-99]) in the toripalimab plus celecoxib group and 11 of 17 patients (65\% [38-86]) in the toripalimab monotherapy group had a pathological complete response. All patients continued to receive adjuvant toripalimab with or without celecoxib for a total perioperative duration of 6 months and were alive and free of recurrence at data cutoff. During neoadjuvant treatment, ten (59\%) patients in the toripalimab plus celecoxib group and ten (59\%) in the toripalimab monotherapy group had grade 1-2 treatment-related adverse events. Only one (3\%) of 34 patients, who was in the toripalimab plus celecoxib group, had a grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse event during the neoadjuvant phase, which was grade 3 increased aspartate aminotransferase levels. In the adjuvant phase, only one (3\%) of 34 patients, who was in the toripalimab monotherapy group, had a grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events, which was grade 3 increased aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels. INTERPRETATION: Neoadjuvant toripalimab with or without celecoxib could be a potential therapeutic option for patients with mismatch repair deficient or microsatellite instability-high, locally advanced, colorectal cancer. This treatment was associated with a high pathological complete response rate and an acceptable safety profile, which did not compromise surgery. Longer term follow-up is needed to assess effects on survival-related endpoints.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Post-chemoradiotherapy (CRT) FDG PET is a useful prognosticator of esophageal cancer. However, debate on the diverse criteria of previous publications preclude worldwide multicenter comparisons, and even a universal practice guide. We aimed to validate a simple qualitative interpretation criterion of post-CRT FDG PET for outcome stratification and compare it with other criteria. METHODS: The post-CRT FDG PET of 114 patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) were independently interpreted using a qualitative 4-point scale (Qual4PS) that identified focal esophageal FDG uptake greater than liver uptake as residual tumor. Cohen's {$\kappa$} coefficient ({$\kappa$}) was used to measure interobserver agreement of Qual4PS. The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were used for survival analysis. Other criteria included a different qualitative approach (QualBK), maximal standardized uptake values (SUVmax3.4, SUVmax2.5), relative change of SUVmax between pre- and post-CRT FDG PET ({$\Delta$}SUVmax), mean standardized uptake values (SUVmean), metabolic volume (MV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG). RESULTS: Overall interobserver agreement on the Qual4PS criterion was excellent ({$\kappa$}: 0.95). Except the QualBK, SUVmax2.5, and TLG, all the other criteria were significant predictors for overall survival (OS). Multivariable analysis showed only Qual4PS (HR: 15.41; P = 0.005) and AJCC stage (HR: 2.47; P = 0.007) were significant independent variables. The 2-year OS rates of Qual4PS(-) patients undergoing CRT alone (68.4\%) and patients undergoing trimodality therapy (62.5\%) were not significant different, but the 2-year OS rates of Qual4PS(+) patients undergoing CRT alone (10.0\%) were significantly lower than in patients undergoing trimodality therapy (42.1\%). CONCLUSIONS: The Qual4PS criterion is reproducible for assessing the response of ESCC to CRT, and valuable for predicting survival. It may add value to response-adapted treatment for ESCC patients, and help to decide whether surgery is warranted after CRT.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The nutritional status of esophageal cancer patients during neoadjuvant therapy remains a challenging problem. The objective of this study was to determine whether routine enteral feeding tube placement improved nutritional status and perioperative outcomes for patients undergoing neoadjuvant therapy for esophageal cancer. METHODS: The Society of Thoracic Surgeons database was used to identify patients who underwent neoadjuvant therapy and esophagectomy at our institution between 2010 and 2014. Nutritional status before and after neoadjuvant therapy was determined through standardized nutrition consultations. Predictors of change in nutrition and adverse events were evaluated with multivariable and univariate logistic regressions. RESULTS: Two hundred thirty-four esophagectomy patients were identified, and 127 (54\%) received neoadjuvant therapy. Of those receiving neoadjuvant therapy, 80\% (102/127) presented with dysphagia, and 48\% (61/127) received enteral feeding access (EA). Multivariable regression revealed that high initial albumin level, high initial body mass index, and presence of EA were associated with nutritional stability during neoadjuvant therapy. However, 27.9\% (17/61) of patients who received EA did not use their access at all or did not use it consistently during the course of preoperative treatment. The preoperative grades of malnutrition and esophagectomy outcomes were similar between groups (EA vs no EA). CONCLUSIONS: EA is associated with improved nutritional status for patients undergoing neoadjuvant therapy for esophageal cancer. However, adverse events and suboptimal use are common. Esophagectomy outcomes were similar for patients with and without EA. These results support judicious patient selection for EA, expedited neoadjuvant therapy, and close collaboration with nutritionists.},

METHODS: We randomly assigned 220 patients with adenocarcinoma of the mid-to-distal esophagus or adenocarcinoma of the gastric cardia involving the distal esophagus either to transhiatal esophagectomy or to transthoracic esophagectomy with extended en bloc lymphadenectomy. Principal end points were overall survival and disease-free survival. Early morbidity and mortality, the number of quality-adjusted life-years gained, and cost effectiveness were also determined. RESULTS: A total of 106 patients were assigned to undergo transhiatal esophagectomy, and 114 to undergo transthoracic esophagectomy. Demographic characteristics and characteristics of the tumor were similar in the two groups. Perioperative morbidity was higher after transthoracic esophagectomy, but there was no significant difference in in-hospital mortality (P=0.45). After a median follow-up of 4.7 years, 142 patients had died--74 (70 percent) after transhiatal resection and 68 (60 percent) after transthoracic resection (P=0.12). Although the difference in survival was not statistically significant, there was a trend toward a survival benefit with the extended approach at five years: disease-free survival was 27 percent in the transhiatal-esophagectomy group, as compared with 39 percent in the transthoracic-esophagectomy group (95 percent confidence interval for the difference, -1 to 24 percent [the negative value indicates better survival with transhiatal resection]), whereas overall survival was 29 percent as compared with 39 percent (95 percent confidence interval for the difference, -3 to 23 percent). CONCLUSIONS: Transhiatal esophagectomy was associated with lower morbidity than transthoracic esophagectomy with extended en bloc lymphadenectomy. Although median overall, disease-free, and quality-adjusted survival did not differ statistically between the groups, there was a trend toward improved long-term survival at five years with the extended transthoracic approach.},

  abstract = {The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) convened a subcommittee to develop recommendations on improving the evidence base for treating older adults with cancer in response to a critical need identified by the Institute of Medicine. Older adults experience the majority of cancer diagnoses and deaths and make up the majority of cancer survivors. Older adults are also the fastest growing segment of the US population. However, the evidence base for treating this population is sparse, because older adults are underrepresented in clinical trials, and trials designed specifically for older adults are rare. The result is that clinicians have less evidence on how to treat older adults, who represent the majority of patients with cancer. Clinicians and patients are forced to extrapolate from trials conducted in younger, healthier populations when developing treatment plans. This has created a dearth of knowledge regarding the risk of toxicity in the average older patient and about key end points of importance to older adults. ASCO makes five recommendations to improve evidence generation in this population: (1) Use clinical trials to improve the evidence base for treating older adults with cancer, (2) leverage research designs and infrastructure for generating evidence on older adults with cancer, (3) increase US Food and Drug Administration authority to incentivize and require research involving older adults with cancer, (4) increase clinicians' recruitment of older adults with cancer to clinical trials, and (5) use journal policies to improve researchers' reporting on the age distribution and health risk profiles of research participants.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Weight loss is a cardinal symptom of oesophageal cancer and is often continued after surgery. High body mass index (BMI) is a strong risk factor for oesophageal adenocarcinoma. This study aimed to assess the impact of pre- and post-operative weight loss and BMI on long-term mortality after resection for oesophageal cancer. METHODS: This prospective and nationwide cohort study included 390 patients, operated on for oesophageal cancer in Sweden in 2001-2005 with follow-up until 2016, who responded to a questionnaire on weight history 6 months after surgery. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models provided hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CIs) of mortality while adjusting for several prognostic factors, including tumour stage. RESULTS: Compared to weight stable patients, pre-surgery weight loss indicated increased HRs of overall all-cause mortality (HR~=~1.32, 95\% CI 0.94-1.86) and disease-specific mortality (HR~=~1.36, 95\% CI 0.93-1.98). Patients with {$>$}20\% weight loss post-surgery had worse overall all-cause mortality (HR~=~1.71, 95\% CI 1.01-2.88) and disease-specific mortality (HR~=~2.20, 95\% CI 1.24-3.89). Compared to patients with normal BMI, decreased HRs were indicated for patients who were obese at the time of surgery (overall all-cause mortality HR 0.87 95\% CI, 0.58-1.31 and disease-specific mortality HR~=~0.89, 95\% CI 0.57-1.40), while patients with BMI {$\leq$}19.9~at 6 months post-surgery had increased all-cause mortality (HR~=~1.41, 95\% CI 1.03-1.95) and disease-specific mortality (HR~=~1.55, 95\% CI 1.09-2.21). CONCLUSION: Post-operative weight loss and low BMI at 6 months post-surgery are independent markers of poor prognosis in patients who undergo surgery for oesophageal cancer.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of metabolic tumor volume (MTV) measured by (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ((18)F-FDG PET) in patients with esophageal carcinoma. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 151 patients with pathologically proven esophageal carcinoma (146 squamous cell carcinomas and 5 adenocarcinomas) who underwent pretreatment (18)F-FDG PET. MTV and maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) for the primary tumors were measured by (18)F-FDG PET. The prognostic significance of MTV, SUVmax, and other clinicopathological variables was assessed by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. To further evaluate and compare the predictive performance of PET parameters, MTV and SUVmax, time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis was used. RESULTS: In the univariate analysis, age, American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage, tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) factors, MTV, and SUVmax of primary tumor were significant predictors of survival. On multivariate analysis adjusted for age, sex, and treatment modality, independent predictive factors associated with decreased overall survival were T stage [hazard ratio (HR) 4.325, P = 0.006], M stage (HR 2.009, P = 0.007), and MTV (HR 1.013, P = 0.021). SUVmax was not a significant factor (HR 0.97, P = 0.061). On time-dependent ROC analysis, MTV showed good predictive performance for overall survival consistently better than SUVmax. CONCLUSION: MTV, a volumetric parameter of (18)F-FDG PET, is an important independent prognostic factor for survival and a better predictor of survival than SUVmax for the primary tumor in patients with esophageal carcinoma.},

The aim of this study was to clarify the relationship between sarcopenia and postoperative outcome in patients with ESCC treated by esophagectomy. METHODS: Skeletal muscle mass was assessed in 138 patients who underwent esophagectomy from August 2009 to May 2014. A multifrequency bioelectrical impedance analysis (InBody 720; Biospace, Tokyo, Japan) was used to assess skeletal muscle mass just before surgery. Postoperative complications were graded according to the Clavien-Dindo classification, and univariate and multivariate analyses were performed for postoperative respiratory complications. RESULTS: Sarcopenia was determined in 61 patients (44.2 \%). Preoperative pulmonary function was significantly lower and the rate of respiratory complications significantly higher in the sarcopenia group than in the non-sarcopenia group (p {$<$} 0.01). For other complications, the differences were not significant. Multivariate analysis showed that sarcopenia [odds ratio (OR) 5.82; p = 0.0001] and longer operation time (OR 3.09; p = 0.04) were risk factors for the occurrence of respiratory complications. CONCLUSIONS: Sarcopenia may be a predictor of pulmonary complications after esophagectomy. Further analysis is needed to clarify whether nutritional intervention improves skeletal muscle mass and thus contributes to reducing postoperative respiratory complications in sarcopenic patients.},

METHODS: This retrospective study included a total of 211 consecutive patients aged {$\geq$}75\,years who underwent radical gastrectomy due to gastric cancer. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to determine the optimal cutoff values for various perioperative factors. Risk factors for the overall survival and death from other diseases were analyzed using the Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: Among the all perioperative factors, sex, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, skeletal muscle mass index, and lymph node dissection in accordance with guidelines or not extracted as independent risk factors for death from other diseases. In an analysis restricted to the preoperative factors, sex, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and skeletal muscle mass index of the patients were extracted as independent risk factors for death from other diseases and overall survival. We divided the patients into four groups according to the number of preoperative risk factors for death from other diseases and found that the 5-year non-gastric-cancer-related survival was different among the four groups (risk factor 0, 91.7\%; risk factor 1, 83.3\%; risk factor 2, 56.3\%; risk factor 3, 27.2\%; P\,{$<$}\,0.001). CONCLUSION: Male sex, low skeletal muscle mass index, and high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio are risk factors for non-gastric-cancer-related death and the overall survival of elderly patients undergoing gastrectomy. Cautious treatment strategies are needed for elderly gastric cancer patients with many risk factors.},

Reduced pulmonary functions and exercise capacity are known as risk factors for complications after esophagectomy. The 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) measured by the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) is a simple field test that can be used to evaluate the functional exercise capacity of patients who undergo thoracic surgery. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of the preoperative 6MWD with postoperative complications in patients with esophageal cancer. Records of a total of 111 patients who underwent thoracic surgery followed by postoperative rehabilitation from January 2013 to December 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. Data of patients who experienced Clavien-Dindo grade II or severer (grade~{$\geq~$}II) complications were compared with those who experienced grade~{$\leq$}I complications. The 6MWD was significantly correlated with age, serum albumin concentration, hemoglobin concentration, and hand grip strength. A total of 42 patients experienced grade~{$\geq$}II. The 6MWD of patients with grade~{$\geq~$}II complications was significantly shorter than that of those with grade~{$\leq$}I complications. In receiver operating characteristic analysis, 6MWD~{$\leq~$}454 m was a threshold for predicting grade~{$\geq$}II complications with 71.0\% sensitivity and 54.8\% specificity. The incidence of grade~{$\geq$}II complications led to delayed ambulation and longer stays in hospital. In the multiple regression analysis, the preoperative risk factors for incidence of grade~{$\geq$}II complications included lower levels of preoperative 6MWD and \% of the predicted value of forced expiratory volume in 1~second. Our results indicate that the 6MWT is useful to assess preoperative physical status in patients with esophageal cancer.},

This study is a single institution retrospective analysis of outcome after esophagectomy for cancer of the esophagus and GEJ in patients aged over 75 years. METHODS: All consecutive patients 76 years old and over undergoing curative esophagectomy for cancer in the period 1991-2006 were analyzed as to comorbidities, outcome and long-term survival. All the data had been prospectively collected in a database. Postoperative mortality risk was assessed by P-POSSUM and O-POSSUM score for in-hospital mortality and by the recently published Steyerberg's score system [Steyerberg EW, Neville BA, Koppert LB, Lemmens VEPP, Tilanus HW, Coebergh JWW, Weeks JC, Earle CC. Surgical mortality in patients with esophageal cancer: development and validation of a simple risk score. J Clin Oncol 2006;24:4277-84.] for 30-day mortality. Five-year survival was compared to the standardized survival in the general population. RESULTS: One hundred and eight patients fulfilling the abovementioned criteria were found (76 males and 32 females, mean age 79.5 years, mean standardized life-expectancy: 7.36 years). Among them, 69\% had esophageal tumors and 31\% GEJ tumors. The predominant histology was adenocarcinoma (74\%). Eighty-six (79.6\%) presented with one or more major comorbidities or a history of previous major upper-GI surgery, potentially affecting the surgical outcome. All underwent resection with curative intent (R(0) 83.3\%, R(1) 12\%, R(2) 4.6\%). The overall postoperative morbidity rate was 51.9\%, pulmonary complications (37\%) being the most frequent. Postoperative mortality, mainly due to cardiopulmonary complications, was 7.4\%, which was consistent with that predicted by P-POSSUM score (7.2\%) and lower than that predicted by O-POSSUM score (15.1\%). Thirty-day mortality was 5.5\%, being consistent with that predicted by the Steyerberg's score (6.8\%). Overall 5-year survival was 35.7\%, while R(0) overall survival 42\% and cancer specific R(0) survival 51.7\%. CONCLUSIONS: Patients 76 years old and over with esophageal or GEJ cancer should not be denied surgery solely on the basis of age. Outcome and long-term results in the selected elderly are not differing from those reported for younger patients. However, despite thorough preoperative assessment being applied in the selection of the candidates for surgery, a practical and reliable individual risk-analysis stratification is still lacking.},

  abstract = {AIM: To develop a fully automated deep-learning-based approach to measure muscle area for assessing sarcopenia on standard-of-care computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen without any case exclusion criteria, for opportunistic screening for frailty. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This ethically approved retrospective study used publicly available and institutional unselected abdominal CT images (n=1,070 training, n=31 testing). The method consisted of two sequential steps: section detection from CT volume followed by muscle segmentation on single-section. Both stages used fully convolutional neural networks (FCNN), based on a UNet-like architecture. Input data consisted of CT volumes with a variety of fields of view, section thicknesses, occlusions, artefacts, and anatomical variations. Output consisted of segmented muscle area on a CT section at the L3 vertebral level. The muscle was segmented into erector spinae, psoas, and rectus abdominus muscle groups. Output was tested against expert manual segmentation. RESULTS: Threefold cross-validation was used to evaluate the model. Section detection cross-validation error was 1.41~{$\pm~$}5.02 (in sections). Segmentation cross-validation Dice overlaps were 0.97~{$\pm~$}0.02, 0.95~{$\pm~$}0.04, and 0.94~{$\pm~$}0.04 for erector spinae, psoas, and rectus abdominus, respectively, and 0.96~{$\pm~$}0.02 for the combined muscle area, with R2~=~0.95/0.98 for muscle attenuation/area in 28/31 hold-out test cases. No statistical difference was found between the automated output and a second annotator. Fully automated processing took {$<$}1 second per CT examination. CONCLUSIONS: A FCNN pipeline accurately and efficiently automates muscle segmentation at the L3 vertebral level from unselected abdominal CT volumes, with no manual processing step. This approach is promising as a generalisable tool for opportunistic screening for frailty on standard-of-care CT.},

However NAC has adverse effects. We assess here whether NAC adversely affects physical fitness and whether such an effect is associated with impaired survival following surgery. METHODS: We prospectively studied 116 patients with oesophageal or gastric cancer to assess the effect of NAC on physical fitness, of whom 89 underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) before NAC and proceeded to surgery. 39 patients were tested after all cycles of NAC but prior to surgery. Physical fitness was assessed by measuring oxygen uptake (VO{$_2$} in ml kg(-1) min(-1)) at the estimated lactate threshold (\texttheta L) and at peak exercise (VO{$_2$} peak in ml kg(-1) min(-1)). RESULTS: VO{$_2$} at \texttheta L and at peak were significantly lower after NAC compared to pre-NAC values: VO{$_2$} at \texttheta L 14.5 {$\pm$} 3.8 (baseline) vs. 12.3 {$\pm$} 3.0 (post-NAC) ml kg(-1) min(-1); p {$\leq$} 0.001; VO{$_2$} peak 20.8 {$\pm$} 6.0 vs. 18.3 {$\pm$} 5.1 ml kg(-1) min(-1); p {$\leq$} 0.001; absolute VO{$_2$} (ml min(-1)) at \texttheta L and peak were also lower post-NAC; p {$\leq$} 0.001. Decreased baseline VO{$_2$} at \texttheta L and peak were associated with increased one year mortality in patients who completed a full course of NAC and had surgery; p = 0.014. CONCLUSION: NAC before cancer surgery significantly reduced physical fitness in the overall cohort. Lower baseline fitness was associated with reduced one-year-survival in patients completing NAC and surgery, but not in patients who did not complete NAC. It is possible that in some patients the harms of NAC may outweigh the benefits. Trials Registry Number: NCT01335555.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chemoradiation became the standard of care for anal cancer after the ACT I trial. However, only two-thirds of patients achieved local control, with 5-year survival of 50\%; therefore, better treatments are needed. We investigated whether replacing mitomycin with cisplatin in chemoradiation improves response, and whether maintenance chemotherapy after chemoradiation improves survival. METHODS: In this 2 \texttimes{} 2 factorial trial, we enrolled patients with histologically confirmed squamous-cell carcinoma of the anus without metastatic disease from 59 centres in the UK. Patients were randomly assigned to one of four groups, to receive either mitomycin (12 mg/m(2) on day 1) or cisplatin (60 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 29), with fluorouracil (1000 mg/m(2) per day on days 1-4 and 29-32) and radiotherapy (50.4 Gy in 28 daily fractions); with or without two courses of maintenance chemotherapy (fluorouracil and cisplatin at weeks 11 and 14). The random allocation was generated by computer and patients assigned by telephone. Randomisation was done by minimisation and stratified by tumour site, T and N stage, sex, age, and renal function. Neither patients nor investigators were masked to assignment. Primary endpoints were complete response at 26 weeks and acute toxic effects (for chemoradiation), and progression-free survival (for maintenance). The primary analyses were done by intention to treat. This study is registered at controlled-trials.com, number 26715889. FINDINGS: We enrolled 940 patients: 472 were assigned to mitomycin, of whom 246 were assigned to no maintenance, 226 to maintenance; 468 were assigned to cisplatin, of whom 246 were assigned to no maintenance, 222 to maintenance. Median follow-up was 5.1 years (IQR 3.9-6.9). 391 of 432 (90.5\%) patients in the mitomycin group versus 386 of 431 (89.6\%) in the cisplatin group had a complete response at 26 weeks (difference -0.9\%, 95\% CI -4.9 to 3.1; p=0.64). Overall, toxic effects were similar in each group (334/472 [71\%] for mitomycin vs 337/468 [72\%] for cisplatin). The most common grade 3-4 toxic effects were skin (228/472 [48\%] vs 222/468 [47\%]), pain (122/472 [26\%] vs 135/468 [29\%]), haematological (124/472 [26\%] vs 73/468 [16\%]), and gastrointestinal (75/472 [16\%] vs 85/468 [18\%]). 3-year progression-free survival was 74\% (95\% CI 69-77; maintenance) versus 73\% (95\% CI 68-77; no maintenance; hazard ratio 0.95, 95\% CI 0.75-1.21; p=0.70). INTERPRETATION: The results of our trial--the largest in anal cancer to date--show that fluorouracil and mitomycin with 50.4 Gy radiotherapy in 28 daily fractions should remain standard practice in the UK.

  abstract = {Background Abdominal and thoracic CT provide a valuable opportunity for osteoporosis screening regardless of the clinical indication for imaging. Purpose To establish reference normative ranges for first lumbar vertebra (L1) trabecular attenuation values across all adult ages to measure bone mineral density (BMD) at routine CT. Materials and Methods Reference data were constructed from 20 374 abdominal and/or thoracic CT examinations performed at 120 kV. Data were derived from adults (mean age, 60 years {$\pm$} 12 [standard deviation]; 56.1\% [11 428 of 20 374] women). CT examinations were performed with (n = 4263) or without (n = 16 111) intravenous contrast agent administration for a variety of unrelated clinical indications between 2000 and 2018. L1 Hounsfield unit measurement was obtained either with a customized automated tool (n = 11 270) or manually by individual readers (n = 9104). The effects of patient age, sex, contrast agent, and manual region-of-interest versus fully automated L1 Hounsfield unit measurement were assessed using multivariable logistic regression analysis. Results Mean L1 attenuation decreased linearly with age at a rate of 2.5 HU per year, averaging 226 HU {$\pm$} 44 for patients younger than 30 years and 89 HU {$\pm$} 38 for patients 90 years or older. Women had a higher mean L1 attenuation compared with men (P {$<$} .008) until menopause, after which both groups had similar values. Administration of intravenous contrast agent resulted in negligible differences in mean L1 attenuation values except in patients younger than 40 years. The fully automated method resulted in measurements that were average 21 HU higher compared with manual measurement (P {$<$} .004); at intrapatient subanalysis, this difference was related to the level of transverse measurement used (midvertebra vs off-midline level). Conclusion Normative ranges of L1 vertebra trabecular attenuation were established across all adult ages, and these can serve as a quick reference at routine CT to identify adults with low bone mineral density who are at risk for osteoporosis. \textcopyright{} RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

  abstract = {Background We aimed to assess the clinical characteristics of sarcopenia by the original and revised European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP 1 and 2), and to propose a new sarcopenia phenotype score (SPS) to improve relevance of clinical outcomes. Methods Analyses were performed in 1408 older adults of the Aging Study of PyeongChang Rural Area, a community-based cohort in Korea. For sarcopenia definitions, we used EWGSOP 1, EWGSOP 2, and SPS, a new index counting number of abnormal domains among components of grip strength, gait speed, or muscle mass. Frailty status by the frailty index and the Cardiovascular Health Study frailty score was compared with sarcopenia measures. Prediction ability for composite outcome combining death and institutionalization due to functional decline was assessed among sarcopenia measures. Results Generally, sarcopenia spectrum by both EWGSOP 1 and 2 was associated with worse functional status in parameters of geriatric assessments. However, population who were considered as sarcopenic by EWGSOP 1, but not by EWGSOP 2, showed increased risk of composite outcome and worse frailty status, compared with people who were classified as not sarcopenic by both EWGSOP 1 and 2. With SPS, dose\textendash response relationship was observed with both frailty status and outcome prediction. Prediction for composite outcome was better in SPS than in EWGSOP 2 classification. Conclusions A new SPS might be used to classify sarcopenic burden in older adults to resolve possible inconsistencies in phenotype correlation and outcome prediction of EWGSOP 2 criteria.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nutritional deficits, cachexia, and sarcopenia are extremely common in esophageal cancer. The aim of this article was to assess the effect of loss of skeletal muscle mass during neoadjuvant treatment on the prognosis of esophageal cancer patients. METHODS: Esophageal cancer patients (N~=\,115) undergoing neoadjuvant therapy and surgery between 2010 and 2014 were identified from our surgery database and retrospectively analyzed. Computed tomography imaging of the total cross-sectional muscle tissue measured at the third lumbar level defined the skeletal muscle index, which defined sarcopenia (SMI\,{$<$}\,52.4~cm2/m2 for men and {$<$}\,38.5~cm2/m2 for women). Images were collected before and after neoadjuvant treatments. RESULTS: Sarcopenia in preoperative imaging was prevalent in 92 patients (80\%). Median overall survival was 900~days (interquartile range 334-1447) with no difference between sarcopenic (median\,=\,900) and non-sarcopenic (median\,=\,914) groups (p~=\,0.872). Complication rates did not differ (26.1\% vs 32.6\%, p~=\,0.725). A 2.98\% decrease in skeletal muscle index during neoadjuvant treatment correlated with poor 2-year survival (log-rank p~=\,0.04). CONCLUSION: Loss of skeletal muscle tissue during neoadjuvant treatment correlates with worse overall survival.},

The authors evaluated initial standardized unit value (iSUV) of 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography and its association with overall survival and the degree of pathologic response after surgery. METHODS: The authors analyzed 161 patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma who had chemoradiation followed by surgery. The log-rank test, univariate Cox proportional hazards model, Kaplan-Meier survival plot, and Fisher exact test were used to analyze dichotomized iSUV and its association with overall survival and pathologic response. RESULTS: The median age of 161 patients was 61 years (range, 26-80 years) and the majority of patients had lower esophageal or gastroesophageal junction involvement. All patients received fluoropyrimidine and, most commonly, a taxane or platinum compound with concomitant radiation. The median radiation dose was 45 grays (Gy) (range, 45 Gy-50.4 Gy). The median iSUV for all patients was 10.1 (range, 0-58). Using the Fisher exact test, iSUV was not found to be associated with the location of the primary cancer. iSUV higher than the median (10.1) was associated with a better pathologic response (P = .06). Patients with primary cancer with iSUV {$>$}10.1 had a lower risk for death (hazards ratio of 0.56) compared with those with iSUV {$<$} or = 10.1. Higher iSUV was nonsignificantly associated with improved survival (P = .07). CONCLUSIONS: Data from the current study suggest that lower iSUV is associated with poor survival and lower probability of response to chemoradiation. iSUV needs to be further evaluated because it may be used to complement other imaging or biomarker assessments to individualize therapy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: This initiative aims to build a global consensus around core diagnostic criteria for malnutrition in adults in clinical settings. METHODS: The Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) was convened by several of the major global clinical nutrition societies. Empirical consensus was reached through a series of face-to-face meetings, telephone conferences, and e-mail communications. RESULTS: A 2-step approach for the malnutrition diagnosis was selected, that is, first screening to identify at risk status by the use of any validated screening tool, and second, assessment for diagnosis and grading the severity of malnutrition. The malnutrition criteria for consideration were retrieved from existing approaches for screening and assessment. Potential criteria were subjected to a ballot among GLIM participants that selected 3 phenotypic criteria (non-volitional weight loss, low body mass index, and reduced muscle mass) and 2 etiologic criteria (reduced food intake or assimilation, and inflammation or disease burden). To diagnose malnutrition at least 1 phenotypic criterion and 1 etiologic criterion should be present. Phenotypic metrics for grading severity are proposed. It is recommended that the etiologic criteria be used to guide intervention and anticipated outcomes. The recommended approach supports classification of malnutrition into four etiology-related diagnosis categories. CONCLUSIONS: A consensus scheme for diagnosing malnutrition in adults in clinical settings on a global scale is proposed. Next steps are to secure endorsements from leading nutrition professional societies, to identify overlaps with syndromes like cachexia and sarcopenia, and to promote dissemination, validation studies, and feedback. The construct should be re-considered every 3-5 years.},

Patients with more comorbidities or advanced age are more likely to be given definitive chemoradiation due to surgical risk. We aimed to identify subsets of patients in whom the addition of surgery to chemoradiation does not provide an overall survival (OS) benefit. The National Cancer Database was queried for patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer who received either definitive chemoradiation or neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery. Bivariate analysis was used to assess the association between patient characteristics and treatment groups. Log-rank tests and Cox proportional hazards models were performed to assess for differences in survival. A total of 15,090 with adenocarcinoma and 5,356 with squamous cell carcinoma met the inclusion criteria. Patients treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation and surgery had significantly improved survival by Cox proportional hazards model regardless of histology if {$<$}50, 50-60, 61-70, or 71-80~years old. There was no significant benefit or detriment in patients 81-90~years old.

The results of these studies support the concept that, just as in many other solid malignancies, systemic spread may happen at an early stage in non-small cell lung cancer and esophageal cancer. Such systemic spread is often occult (micrometastases) at the time of primary diagnosis, which may have adverse effects on survival. Improved staging can be expected with information on micrometastases, and a subgroup of patients who will benefit most from adjuvant therapy might be identified. Although reliable and standard methods need to be developed before detection of micrometastasis is incorporated in the routine clinical practice, we suggest that it be considered an important correlate in clinical trials in non-small cell lung cancer and esophageal cancer.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with distal or middle-third, clinical primary tumor stage 3-4 and/or regional lymph node-positive rectal cancer were randomly assigned (1:1) to short-term radiotherapy (25 Gy in five fractions over 1 week) followed by four cycles of chemotherapy (total neoadjuvant therapy [TNT]) or chemoradiotherapy (50 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks, concurrently with capecitabine [chemoradiotherapy; CRT]). Total mesorectal excision was undertaken 6-8 weeks after preoperative treatment, with two additional cycles of CAPOX (intravenous oxaliplatin [130 mg/m2, once a day] on day 1 and capecitabine [1,000 mg/m2, twice a day] from days 1 to 14) in the TNT group and six cycles of CAPOX in the CRT group. The primary end point was 3-year disease-free survival (DFS). RESULTS: Between August 2015 and August 2018, a total of 599 patients were randomly assigned to receive TNT (n = 302) or CRT (n = 297). At a median follow-up of 35.0 months, 3-year DFS was 64.5\% and 62.3\% in TNT and CRT groups, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.883; one-sided 95\% CI, not applicable to 1.11; P {$<$} .001 for noninferiority). There was no significant difference in metastasis-free survival or locoregional recurrence, but the TNT group had better 3-year overall survival than the CRT group (86.5\% v 75.1\%; P = .033). Treatment effects on DFS and overall survival were similar regardless of prognostic factors. The prevalence of acute grade III-V toxicities during preoperative treatment was 26.5\% in the TNT group versus 12.6\% in the CRT group (P {$<$} .001). CONCLUSION: Short-term radiotherapy with preoperative chemotherapy followed by surgery was efficacious with acceptable toxicity and could be used as an alternative to CRT for locally advanced rectal cancer.},

DESIGN: We searched several databases to collect relevant studies conducted until July 2019. We carefully reviewed the full text of the included publications and combined the HRs and 95\% CIs to assess the association between the NLR and survival time in patients with lung cancer receiving immunotherapy. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Embase and Web of Science ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Studies reporting the prognostic value of the NLR in patients with lung cancer receiving immunotherapy were enrolled. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Basic information on the articles and patients (NLR cut-off value, NLR at baseline and HRs with 95\% CIs for OS and PFS) was extracted by two authors independently. The pooled HRs of OS and PFS were synthesised using the random effects or fixed effects model. RESULTS: Twenty-three studies with 2068 patients were enrolled. Among all patients, 1305 (64.0\%) were men and 643 (31.4\%) were diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). In a pooled analysis of OS and PFS from all studies, an elevated NLR predicted poor OS (HR=1.62; 95\%\,CI: 1.41 to 1.87; p{$<$}0.001) and PFS (HR=1.47; 95\%\,CI: 1.25 to 1.72; p{$<$}0.001). Subgroup analyses stratified showed that the post-treatment NLR was not significantly related to OS and that patients in Asia had significantly higher HRs than those in Europe and America. Furthermore, the proportion of SCC and baseline NLR could affect the prognostic value of the NLR. CONCLUSIONS: Our study found that an elevated NLR was associated with poor OS and PFS in patients with lung cancer receiving immunotherapy and that several clinical factors might have an impact on the predictive value of the NLR in the survival of patients with lung cancer.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this study was to evaluate if the use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) reduced the prevalence of benign anastomotic strictures after uncomplicated esophagectomies with gastric tube reconstruction and circular stapled anastomoses. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Benign anastomotic strictures are associated with anastomotic leaks or conduit ischemia. Also patients without those complications develop benign anastomotic strictures. We hypothesize that patients without postoperative anastomotic complications may develop benign anastomotic strictures due to exposure of acid gastric tube contents to the anastomotic area, and that the formation of such strictures may be reduced by prophylactic use of PPIs. METHODS: Eighty patients without preoperative chemo- or radiotherapy, without clinical or radiological signs of anastomotic leaks were included in this clinical trial. The patients were randomized to b.i.d. PPIs or no treatment for 1 year. Benign anastomotic strictures were defined as anastomotic narrowing not allowing a standard diagnostic endoscope to pass without dilatation. The study was registered in the EudraCT database (2009-009997-28) for clinical trials. RESULTS: : Seventy-nine patients were evaluated. Benign anastomotic strictures developed in 5/39 (13\%) patients in the PPI group and in 18/40 (45\%) in the control group (RR 5.6, 95\% CI: 2.0-15.9, P = 0.001). The use of a narrower 25 mm cartridge as compared to a wider 28 or 31 mm cartridge significantly increased stricture formations (RR 2.9, 95\% CI: 1.1-7.6, P = 0.025). CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic PPI treatment reduced the prevalence of benign anastomotic strictures following esophagectomy with gastric tube reconstruction and circular stapled anastomoses. Larger sized circular staple cartridges additionally reduced the stricture prevalence.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Thoracotomy induces severe postoperative pain and impairment of pulmonary function, and therefore regional analgesia has been intensively studied in this procedure. Thoracic epidural analgesia is commonly considered the "gold standard" in this setting; however, evaluation of the evidence is needed to assess the comparative benefits of alternative techniques, guide clinical practice and identify areas requiring further research. METHODS: In this systematic review of randomized trials we evaluated thoracic epidural, paravertebral, intrathecal, intercostal, and interpleural analgesic techniques, compared to each other and to systemic opioid analgesia, in adult thoracotomy. Postoperative pain, analgesic use, and complications were analyzed. RESULTS: Continuous paravertebral block was as effective as thoracic epidural analgesia with local anesthetic (LA) but was associated with a reduced incidence of hypotension. Paravertebral block reduced the incidence of pulmonary complications compared with systemic analgesia, whereas thoracic epidural analgesia did not. Thoracic epidural analgesia was superior to intrathecal and intercostal techniques, although these were superior to systemic analgesia; interpleural analgesia was inadequate. CONCLUSIONS: Either thoracic epidural analgesia with LA plus opioid or continuous paravertebral block with LA can be recommended. Where these techniques are not possible, or are contraindicated, intrathecal opioid or intercostal nerve block are recommended despite insufficient duration of analgesia, which requires the use of supplementary systemic analgesia. Quantitative meta-analyses were limited by heterogeneity in study design, and subject numbers were small. Further well designed studies are required to investigate the optimum components of the epidural solution and to rigorously evaluate the risks/benefits of continuous infusion paravertebral and intercostal techniques compared with thoracic epidural analgesia.},

We previously published a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, 16-week trial on effects of once-daily glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analog, liraglutide on weight, satiation, and gastric functions in obese volunteers. The aim of this substudy is to compare to placebo the effects of liraglutide on appetite, taste preference, regional body fat stores, and anthropometric measurements. METHODS: Forty obese adults received standard instruction for weight management, monthly behavioral intervention utilizing motivational interviews, and 16-week treatment of once-daily liraglutide (escalated to 3 mg SQ daily). At baseline and 16 weeks, the following were measured: appetite and taste preferences rated every 30 min for 5 h after ingesting 300 mL Ensure\textregistered; maximal tolerated volume (MTV) with a nutrient drink test; fasting and postprandial bioactive GLP-1 (7-36) and peptide YY (PYY) levels; total and regional body fat with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and waist and hip circumference. RESULTS: Thirty-five participants (17 liraglutide; 18 placebo) completed the trial. Compared to placebo group, liraglutide group had significant reductions in MTV; prospective food consumption score; desire to eat something sweet, salty, savory or fatty; and an increase in perceived fullness. Postprandial plasma levels of GLP-1 decreased and PYY levels increased with liraglutide relative to baseline. Significant reductions in total body, trunk, and upper and lower body fat without reduction in lean body mass were observed. CONCLUSION: Liraglutide 3 mg SQ modulates appetite, taste preference, gut hormones, and regional body fat stores in adults with obesity without reduction in lean body mass.},

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: MIE provides lower postoperative morbidity and mortality, and similar short-term oncological quality compared to OE. METHODS: Data was acquired from the Dutch Upper Gastrointestinal Cancer Audit. Patients undergoing minimally invasive or open, transthoracic or transhiatal esophagectomy for primary esophageal cancer between 2011-2015 were included. A propensity-score matching analysis for MIE versus OE was performed separately for transthoracic and transhiatal esophagectomies. RESULTS: A total of 1036 transthoracic MIE and OE patients, and 582 transhiatal MIE and OE patients were matched. Long-term survival was comparable for MIE and OE for both transthoracic and transhiatal procedures (5-year overall survival: transthoracic MIE 49.2\% vs. OE 51.1\%, p 0.695; transhiatal MIE 48.4\% vs. OE 50.7\%, p 0.832). For both procedures, MIE yielded more lymph nodes (transthoracic median 21 vs. 18, p {$<$} 0.001; transhiatal 15 vs. 13, p 0.007). Post-operative morbidity was comparable after transthoracic MIE and OE (60.8\% vs. 64.9\%, p 0.177), with a reduced length of stay after transthoracic MIE (median 12 vs. 15 days, p {$<$} 0.001). After transhiatal MIE, more postoperative complications (64.9\% vs. 56.4\%, p 0.034) were observed, without subsequent difference in length of stay. CONCLUSION: Long-term survival after minimally invasive esophagectomy was equivalent to open in both propensity-score matched cohorts of patients undergoing transthoracic or transhiatal esophageal resections. Transhiatal minimally invasive esophagectomy was accompanied with more post-operative morbidity. Both transthoracic and transhiatal minimally invasive esophagectomy resulted in a more extended lymphadenectomy.},

The main objective of our study was to determine the effect of preoperative intravenous iron supplementation therapy on the need for red blood cell transfusions, other postoperative complications, and length of hospital stay in colon cancer patients undergoing colon resection. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, data were collected from medical records of all 549 colon carcinoma patients who underwent a colon resection in Helsinki University Hospital during the years 2017 and 2018. The patients were divided into two cohorts: one with anemic patients treated with preoperative intravenous iron supplementation therapy (180 patients) and one with anemic patients without preoperative intravenous iron supplementation therapy (138 patients). Non-anemic patients and patients requiring emergency surgery were excluded (231 patients). RESULTS: Patients treated with intravenous iron had less postoperative complications (33.9\% vs. 45.9\%, p\,=\,0.045) and a lower prevalence of anemia at 1~month after surgery (38.7\% vs. 65.3\%, p\,{$<$}\,0.01) when compared with patients without preoperative iv iron treatment. No difference was found in the amount of red blood cell transfusions, length of stay, or mortality between the groups. CONCLUSION: This is the first study demonstrating a significant decrease in postoperative complications in anemic colon cancer patients receiving preoperative intravenous iron supplementation therapy. This treatment also diminishes the rate of postoperative anemia, which is often associated with a facilitated recovery.},

We conducted a multicenter, randomized trial to determine whether the addition of preoperative radiotherapy increases the benefit of total mesorectal excision. METHODS: We randomly assigned 1861 patients with resectable rectal cancer either to preoperative radiotherapy (5 Gy on each of five days) followed by total mesorectal excision (924 patients) or to total mesorectal excision alone (937 patients). The trial was conducted with the use of standardization and quality-control measures to ensure the consistency of the radiotherapy, surgery, and pathological techniques. RESULTS: Of the 1861 patients randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups, 1805 were eligible to participate. The overall rate of survival at two years among the eligible patients was 82.0 percent in the group assigned to both radiotherapy and surgery and 81.8 percent in the group assigned to surgery alone (P=0.84). Among the 1748 patients who underwent a macroscopically complete local resection, the rate of local recurrence at two years was 5.3 percent. The rate of local recurrence at two years was 2.4 percent in the radiotherapy-plus-surgery group and 8.2 percent in the surgery-only group (P{$<$}0.001).

The authors retrospectively assessed the performance of 18-F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET in the assessment of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). METHODS: The results using PET were compared with those using computed tomography (CT), and these were correlated with the pathologic findings. The authors studied 32 patients with thoracic esophageal SCC who had undergone radical esophagectomy. RESULTS: Uptake of FDG in the primary tumor was found in 25 of the 32 (78.1\%) cases. Comparison of the FDG uptake and the clinicopathologic findings showed that there was a significant association between the FDG uptake and each of the depth of tumor invasion (P {$<$} 0.05), occurrence of lymph node metastasis (P {$<$} 0.01), and lymphatic invasion (P {$<$} 0.01). The survival rate in cases with high FDG uptake (standardized uptake value [SUV], {$>$}3) was significantly lower than that in cases with low FDG uptake (SUV, {$<$} 3; P {$<$} 0.05). In the evaluation of lymph node staging by the detection of lymph node metastasis, FDG-PET showed 77.8\% sensitivity, 92.9\% specificity, and 84.4\% accuracy, and CT scanning showed 61.1\% sensitivity, 71.4\% specificity, and 65.6\% accuracy. Positron emission tomography scanning showed a high degree of accuracy in the neck, upper thoracic, and abdominal regions. However, in the mid- and lower thoracic regions, the sensitivity was very low. The smallest lymph node metastasis that was detected by FDG-PET imaging was 6 mm. The average size of lymph node metastasis that was undetected by FDG-PET scanning was 7.3 mm (range, 1-17 mm). CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, FDG-PET may be used as a noninvasive diagnostic technique in assessing the aggressiveness of the tumor and the prognosis in patients with esophageal SCC. During the preoperative diagnostic procedures, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of lymph node staging is higher with FDG-PET than with CT imaging. In view of the high specificity of FDG-PET, it also gives useful information to guide the choice of treatment of esophageal carcinoma.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Approximately 30\% of adults undergoing non-cardiac surgery suffer from preoperative anaemia. Preoperative anaemia is a risk factor for mortality and adverse outcomes in different surgical specialties and is frequently the reason for blood transfusion. The most common causes are renal, chronic diseases, and iron deficiency. International guidelines recommend that the cause of anaemia guide preoperative anaemia treatment. Recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) with iron supplementation has frequently been used to increase preoperative haemoglobin concentrations in patients in order to avoid the need for perioperative allogeneic red blood cell (RBC) transfusion. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of preoperative rHuEPO therapy (subcutaneous or parenteral) with iron (enteral or parenteral) in reducing the need for allogeneic RBC transfusions in preoperatively anaemic adults undergoing non-cardiac surgery. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE(R), Ovid Embase, ISI Web of Science: SCI-EXPANDED and CPCI-S, and clinical trial registries WHO ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov on 29 August 2019. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared preoperative rHuEPO + iron therapy to control treatment (placebo, no treatment, or standard of care with or without iron) for preoperatively anaemic adults undergoing non-cardiac surgery. We used the World Health Organization (WHO) definition of anaemia: haemoglobin concentration (g/dL) less than 13 g/dL for males, and 12 g/dL for non-pregnant females (decision of inclusion based on mean haemoglobin concentration). We defined two subgroups of rHuEPO dosage: 'low' for 150 to 300 international units (IU)/kg body weight, and 'high' for 500 to 600 IU/kg body weight. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors collected data from the included studies. Our primary outcome was the need for RBC transfusion (no autologous transfusion, fresh frozen plasma or platelets), measured in transfused participants during surgery (intraoperative) and up to five days after surgery. Secondary outcomes of interest were: haemoglobin concentration (directly before surgery), number of RBC units (where one unit contains 250 to 450 mL) transfused per participant (intraoperative and up to five days after surgery), mortality (within 30 days after surgery), length of hospital stay, and adverse events (e.g. renal dysfunction, thromboembolism, hypertension, allergic reaction, headache, fever, constipation). MAIN RESULTS: Most of the included trials were in orthopaedic, gastrointestinal, and gynaecological surgery and included participants with mild and moderate preoperative anaemia (haemoglobin from 10 to 12 g/dL). The duration of preoperative rHuEPO treatment varied across the trials, ranging from once a week to daily or a 5-to-10-day period, and in one trial preoperative rHuEPO was given on the morning of surgery and for five days postoperatively. We included 12 trials (participants = 1880) in the quantitative analysis of the need for~RBC transfusion following preoperative treatment with rHuEPO + iron to correct preoperative anaemia in non-cardiac surgery; two studies were multiarmed trials with two different dose regimens. Preoperative rHuEPO + iron given to anaemic adults reduced the need RBC transfusion (risk ratio (RR) 0.55, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.38 to 0.80; participants = 1880; studies = 12; I2 = 84\%; moderate-quality~evidence due to inconsistency). This analysis suggests that on average, the combined administration of rHuEPO + iron~will mean 231 fewer individuals will need transfusion for every 1000 individuals compared to the control group. Preoperative high-dose rHuEPO + iron given to anaemic adults increased the haemoglobin concentration (mean difference (MD) 1.87 g/dL, 95\% CI 1.26 to 2.49; participants = 852; studies = 3; I2 = 89\%; low-quality evidence due to inconsistency and risk of bias) but not low-dose rHuEPO + iron~(MD 0.11 g/dL, 95\% CI -0.46 to 0.69; participants = 334; studies = 4; I2 = 69\%; low-quality evidence due to inconsistency and risk of bias). There was probably little or no difference in the number of RBC units when rHuEPO + iron was given preoperatively (MD -0.09, 95\% CI -0.23 to 0.05; participants = 1420; studies = 6; I2 = 2\%; moderate-quality evidence due to imprecision).~ There was probably little or no difference in the risk of mortality within 30 days of surgery (RR 1.19, 95\% CI 0.39 to 3.63; participants = 230; studies = 2; I2 = 0\%; moderate-quality evidence due to imprecision) or of adverse events including local rash, fever, constipation, or transient hypertension (RR 0.93, 95\% CI 0.68 to 1.28; participants = 1722; studies = 10; I2 = 0\%; moderate-quality evidence due to imprecision). The administration of rHuEPO + iron~before non-cardiac surgery did not clearly~reduce the length of hospital stay of preoperative anaemic adults (MD -1.07, 95\% CI -4.12 to 1.98; participants = 293; studies = 3; I2 = 87\%; low-quality evidence due to inconsistency and imprecision). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Moderate-quality evidence suggests that preoperative rHuEPO + iron therapy for anaemic adults prior to non-cardiac surgery reduces the need for RBC transfusion and, when given at higher doses, increases the haemoglobin concentration preoperatively. The administration of rHuEPO + iron treatment did not decrease the mean number of units of RBC transfused per patient. There were no important differences in the risk of adverse events or mortality within 30 days, nor in length of hospital stay. Further, well-designed, adequately powered RCTs are required to estimate the impact of this combined treatment more precisely.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to compare health-related quality of life (HRQoL) outcomes between minimally invasive and open oesophagectomy for cancer at different postoperative time points. METHODS: A search of PubMed (MEDLINE), Web of Science, Embase, Scopus, CINAHL and the Cochrane Library was performed for studies that compared open with minimally invasive oesophagectomy. A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted for studies that measured HRQoL scores using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 and QLQ-OES18 questionnaires. Mean differences (MDs) greater than 10 in scores were considered clinically relevant. Pooled effects of MDs with 95 per cent confidence intervals were estimated to assess statistical significance. RESULTS: Nine studies were included in the qualitative analysis, involving 1157 patients who had minimally invasive surgery and 907 patients who underwent open surgery. Minimally invasive surgery resulted in better scores for global quality of life (MD 11{$\cdot$}61, 95 per cent c.i. 3{$\cdot$}84 to 19{$\cdot$}39), physical function (MD 11{$\cdot$}88, 3{$\cdot$}92 to 19{$\cdot$}84), fatigue (MD -13{$\cdot$}18, -17{$\cdot$}59 to -8{$\cdot$}76) and pain (MD -15{$\cdot$}85, -20{$\cdot$}45 to -11{$\cdot$}24) compared with open surgery at 3 months after surgery. At 6 and 12 months, no significant differences remained. CONCLUSION: Patients report better global quality of life, physical function, fatigue and pain 3 months after minimally invasive surgery compared with open surgery. No such differences remain at longer follow-up of 6 and 12 months.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: We surveyed cancer physicians to understand how patients' age and comorbidity influence adjuvant chemotherapy recommendations and whether physician or practice characteristics also affect these recommendations. METHODS: National survey of surgeons and medical oncologists caring for patients with colorectal cancer regarding whether they would recommend adjuvant chemotherapy for hypothetical patients with stage III colon cancer who varied by age (55 v 80 years) and comorbid illness (none, moderate, severe congestive heart failure [CHF]). Repeated measures logistic regression was used to assess the influence of patient, physician, and practice characteristics on chemotherapy recommendations. RESULTS: Of 1,096 physicians, nearly all recommended chemotherapy for patients who were 55 years old with no comorbidity (99.0\%), 55-years old with moderate CHF (88.6\%), or 80 years old with no comorbidity (92.6\%); many fewer recommended chemotherapy for 55-year-old patients with severe CHF (24.9\%) or 80-year-old patients with moderate (47.2\%) or severe (9.0\%) CHF (P {$<$} .001). Younger physicians (P {$<$} .001) were more likely than others to recommend adjuvant chemotherapy overall, although physician factors explained little of the variability in recommendations. CONCLUSION: Physicians agree with guidelines recommending adjuvant chemotherapy for young, healthy patients with stage III colon cancer but differ widely on recommendations for patients who are older and sicker. Few physician or practice characteristics were associated with recommendations. For older and sicker patients, the individual physicians seen may have a substantial impact on the likelihood of receiving chemotherapy. Understanding better the sources of variation not explained by patients' clinical characteristics may allow improved tailoring of therapy to patients most likely to benefit.},

No clear evidence exists outlining which treatment modality should be used in patients with colorectal cancer. The study aimed to compare the efficacy of preoperative intravenous and oral iron in reducing blood transfusion use in anaemic patients undergoing elective colorectal cancer surgery. METHODS: Anaemic patients with non-metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma were recruited at least 2 weeks before surgery and randomized to receive oral (ferrous sulphate) or intravenous (ferric carboxymaltose) iron. Perioperative changes in haemoglobin, ferritin, transferrin saturation and blood transfusion use were recorded until postoperative outpatient review. RESULTS: Some 116 patients were included in the study. There was no difference in blood transfusion use from recruitment to trial completion in terms of either volume of blood administered (P\,=\,0{$\cdot$}841) or number of patients transfused (P\,=\,0{$\cdot$}470). Despite this, increases in haemoglobin after treatment were higher with intravenous iron (median 1{$\cdot$}55 (i.q.r. 0{$\cdot$}93-2{$\cdot$}58) versus 0{$\cdot$}50 (-0{$\cdot$}13 to 1{$\cdot$}33) g/dl; P\,{$<$}\,0{$\cdot$}001), which was associated with fewer anaemic patients at the time of surgery (75 versus 90 per cent; P\,=\,0{$\cdot$}048). Haemoglobin levels were thus higher at surgery after treatment with intravenous than with oral iron (mean 11{$\cdot$}9 (95 per cent c.i. 11{$\cdot$}5 to 12{$\cdot$}3) versus 11{$\cdot$}0 (10{$\cdot$}6 to 11{$\cdot$}4) g/dl respectively; P\,=\,0{$\cdot$}002), as were ferritin (P\,{$<$}\,0{$\cdot$}001) and transferrin saturation (P\,{$<$}\,0{$\cdot$}001) levels. CONCLUSION: Intravenous iron did not reduce the blood transfusion requirement but was more effective than oral iron at treating preoperative anaemia and iron deficiency in patients undergoing colorectal cancer surgery.},

Each variable was first evaluated separately. By conventional statistical methods, none of the variables significantly predicted response, although the following parameters significantly (p less than 0.01) predicted survival: Patients with an initially normal level of lactic dehydrogenase versus those with an abnormal level of lactic dehydrogenase had median survivals of 16 and 7.0 months, respectively; normal versus abnormal carcinoembryonic antigen levels, 23 and 9.2 months, respectively; white blood cell count of less than 10,000 versus greater than 10,000 cells/mm3, 11 and 7.0 months, respectively; performance status of greater than 70 versus less than 60, 11 and 6.6 months, respectively; and lung versus liver metastases, 12 and 8.0 months, respectively. By studying the variables together with multivariate analysis, we found that the most important variables in predicting response were the lactic dehydrogenase level and the white blood cell count. In predicting survival, the most important variables were the lactic dehydrogenase level, performance status, and lung involvement. We recommend that future randomized therapeutic trials for advanced colorectal carcinoma should delineate and perhaps stratify for the lactic dehydrogenase level, performance status, white blood cell count, and/or the presence of lung involvement.},

DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of unstructured EHR notes using a natural language processing (NLP) algorithm. SETTING: Large multispecialty group. PARTICIPANTS: Older adults (N=18,341; average age 75.9, 58.9\% female). MEASUREMENTS: We compared the number of geriatric syndrome cases identified using structured claims and structured and unstructured EHR data. We also calculated these rates using a population-level claims database as a reference and identified comparable epidemiological rates in peer-reviewed literature as a benchmark. RESULTS: Using insurance claims data resulted in a geriatric syndrome prevalence ranging from 0.03\% for lack of social support to 8.3\% for walking difficulty. Using structured EHR data resulted in similar prevalence rates, ranging from 0.03\% for malnutrition to 7.85\% for walking difficulty. Incorporating unstructured EHR notes, enabled by applying the NLP algorithm, identified considerably higher rates of geriatric syndromes: absence of fecal control (2.1\%, 2.3 times as much as structured claims and EHR data combined), decubitus ulcer (1.4\%, 1.7 times as much), dementia (6.7\%, 1.5 times as much), falls (23.6\%, 3.2 times as much), malnutrition (2.5\%, 18.0 times as much), lack of social support (29.8\%, 455.9 times as much), urinary retention (4.2\%, 3.9 times as much), vision impairment (6.2\%, 7.4 times as much), weight loss (19.2\%, 2.9 as much), and walking difficulty (36.34\%, 3.4 as much). The geriatric syndrome rates extracted from structured data were substantially lower than published epidemiological rates, although adding the NLP results considerably closed this gap. CONCLUSION: Claims and structured EHR data give an incomplete picture of burden related to geriatric syndromes. Geriatric syndromes are likely to be missed if unstructured data are not analyzed. Pragmatic NLP algorithms can assist with identifying individuals at high risk of experiencing geriatric syndromes and improving coordination of care for older adults.},

  abstract = {Esophageal cancer is a leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. Complete resection of esophageal cancer and adjacent malignant lymph nodes is the only potentially curative treatment. Accurate preoperative staging and assessment of therapeutic response after neoadjuvant therapy are crucial in determining the most suitable therapy and avoiding inappropriate attempts at curative surgery. Computed tomography (CT) is recommended for initial imaging following confirmation of malignancy at pathologic analysis, primarily to rule out unresectable or distant metastatic disease. With the advent of multidetector CT, use of thin sections and multiplanar reformation allows more accurate staging of esophageal cancer. Endoscopic ultrasonography (US) is the best modality for determining the depth of tumor invasion and presence of regional lymph node involvement. Combined use of fine-needle aspiration and endoscopic US can improve assessment of lymph node involvement. Positron emission tomography (PET) is useful for assessment of distant metastases but is not appropriate for detecting and staging primary tumors. PET may also be helpful in restaging after neoadjuvant therapy, since it allows identification of early response to treatment and detection of interval distant metastases. Each imaging modality has its advantages and disadvantages; therefore, CT, endoscopic US, and PET should be considered complementary modalities for preoperative staging and therapeutic monitoring of patients with esophageal cancer.},

METHODS: Area of pectoralis muscles at the aortic arch (PMA) and at L1 (L1MA) was retrospectively measured on chest CT images of 90 consecutive SCLC patients. Pearson's correlation and multiple linear regression analysis were used to assess relationships between L3MI determined by PET/CT and pectoralis muscle index (PMI) and L1 muscle index (L1MI) determined by chest CT. RESULTS: The correlation between L1MI and L3MI was stronger than that between PMI and L3MI (r~=~0.851 vs. r~=~0.447, p~{$<~$}0.001). Multivariable regression analysis showed that L1MI was the only significant predictor of L3MI; L3MI~=~0.963~\texttimes ~L1MI~+~10.336 (R (2) ~=~0.689, p~{$<~$}0.001) for male and L3MI~=~0.772~\texttimes ~L1MI~+~16.518 (R (2) ~=~0.777, p~{$<~$}0.001) for female. Using this relationship, estimated cutoffs of L1MI for sarcopenia were 46~cm(2)/m(2) for male and 29~cm(2)/m(2) for female (L3MI cutoffs for sarcopenia are 55~cm(2)/m(2) for male and 39~cm(2)/m(2) for female). The sensitivity and specificity of L1MI cutoffs to determine sarcopenia were 98.2 and 100~\%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Chest CT-determined L1MI is highly correlated with L3MI in SCLC patients. L1MI, as determined by chest CT, could be used to determine the presence of sarcopenia with suggested cutoffs of 46~cm(2)/m(2) for men and 29~cm(2)/m(2) for women.},

  abstract = {Introduction: The primary objective of this study was to determine the prognostic significance of computed tomography (CT)determined sarcopenia in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients. Methods: This retrospective study consisted of a total of 149 consecutive SCLC patients. The cross-sectional area of muscle at the level of the third lumbar vertebra (L3) was measured using baseline CT images. Sarcopenia was defined as a L3 muscle index of less than 55\,cm2/m2 for men and of less than 39\,cm2/m2 for women as proposed by international consensus of cancer cachexia. In addition, Korean-specific cutoffs for sarcopenia was also applied (49\,cm2/m2 for men and 31\,cm2/m2 for women). Overall survival (OS) and clinical characteristics of patients with or without sarcopenia were compared. Results: Mean patient age was 68.6\,{$\pm$}\,9.5 years. Most were male (85.3\%) and 67.8\% had extensive disease at time of diagnosis. Sarcopenia was present in 118 patients (79.2\%) and was significantly related to an advanced age (p = 0.028), male sex (p {$<$} 0.001), lower body mass index (p {$<$} 0.001), and poor performance status (p = 0.049). Sarcopenic patients had shorter OS than nonsarcopenic patients (median: 8.6 months versus 16.8 months; p = 0.031). Multivariable analysis revealed that sarcopenia was an independent prognostic factor of poor survival (hazards ratio: 1.68; 95\% confidence interval: 1.04\textendash 2.72; p = 0.034), along with extensive stage (p {$<$} 0.001), supportive care only (p {$<$} 0.001), and an elevated lactate dehydrogenase level (p = 0.020). Using Korean sarcopenia cutoffs, sarcopenic patients were also found to have poorer OS than nonsarcopenic patients, however, the survival difference was not statistically significant (median: 8.4 months versus 12.7 months; p = 0.144 by the log-rank test). Conclusions: Sarcopenia as determined by CT could be used to predict prognosis in patients with SCLC. Optimum reference values},

  abstract = {Background To investigate the clinical impact of sarcopenia and skeletal muscle density (SMD) among patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma who underwent palliative first line gemcitabine-based chemotherapy. Methods A total of 330 patients treated with first line gemcitabine-based chemotherapy between January 2010 and March 2017 were included. CT scans before chemotherapy and after 8{$\pm$}2\,weeks were evaluated. The L3 skeletal muscle index (SMI) was used to detect sarcopenia and calculated as the total area of the L3 skeletal muscle divided by the height-squared (cm2/m2). SMD was quantified as the mean muscle radiation attenuation of the muscle cross-sectional area across the L3 vertebral body level and was assessed between -\,29 and +\,150 Hounsfield units. Results A SMI to SMD comparison revealed a positive correlation (R2 = 0.058, P {$<$}\,0.001). Compared with high SMD, the risks of low SMI were 1.516 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.164\textendash 1.973) among patients with low SMD. Kaplan\textendash Meier analysis showed that the low SMD was related to poor overall survival (OS, median, 6.1 versus [vs.] 7.9\,months, P = 0.010). Multivariate analysis using Cox regression showed that low SMI (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.35, 95\% CI: 1.03\textendash 1.78, P = 0.032) and low SMD (HR: 1.45, 95\% CI: 1.09\textendash 1.93, P = 0.011) were poor prognostic factors for OS, respectively. Co-presence of low SMI and low SMD had more powerful prognostic implication for OS (HR: 1.58, 95\% CI: 1.12\textendash 2.23, P = 0.010). Grade 3 or higher toxicity of chemotherapy was more frequently observed in patients who have a low SMI (43\% vs. 59\%, P = 0.019) and low SMD (44\% vs. 60\%, P = 0.023). OS was not related to SMD status among patients who were chemotherapy responders (complete or partial responses). However, among non-responders (stable or progressive disease), low SMD groups had significantly poorer OS in comparison with high SMD groups (median, 5.6 vs 7.4\,months, P = 0.006). Conclusions Sarcopenia and SMD status can be considered a prognostic factor in patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma who received palliative first line gemcitabine-based chemotherapy. Severe chemotherapy toxicity occurred in the sarcopenia and low SMD groups. Our data suggest that a comprehensive assessment of skeletal muscle parameters may be more useful prognostic factors.

RESULTS: Seventy-eight patients had more than 10\% WL compared to their weight at surgery. On univariate analysis, higher body mass index [(BMI): {$\geq$}20.8; p=0.012] and shorter length of hospitalization [(LOH); p=0.041] demonstrated an association with more than 10\% WL.

  abstract = {Esophagectomy for cancer is associated with high risk for postoperative morbidity. The most serious regularly encountered complication is anastomotic leak and the most feared individual complication is conduit necrosis. Both of these complications affect the length of stay, mortality, quality of life, and survival for patients undergoing esophageal resection. The maintenance of conduit viability is of primary importance in the perioperative care of patients following esophageal resection. It has been shown that restrictive fluid management may be associated with improved postoperative outcomes in abdominal and other types of surgery, but many factors can affect the incidence of anastomotic leak and the viability of the gastric conduit. We have performed a comprehensive review with the aim to give an overview of the available evidence for the use of standardized hemodynamic protocols (SHPs) for esophagectomy and review the hemodynamic protocol, which has been applied within a standardized clinical pathway (SCP) at the Department of Thoracic surgery at the Virginia Mason Medical Center between 2004-2018 where the anastomotic leak rate over the period has been 5.2\% and the incidence of conduit necrosis requiring surgical management is zero. The literature review demonstrates that there are few high quality studies that provide scientific evidence for the use of a SHP. The evidence indicates that the use of goal-directed hemodynamic monitoring might be associated with a reduced risk for postoperative complications, shortened length of stay, and decreased need for intensive care unit stay. We propose that the routine application of a SHP can provide a uniform infrastructure to optimize conduit perfusion and decrease the incidence of anastomotic leak.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Esophageal obstruction due to cancer can produce debilitating dysphagia. Rapid palliation is usually possible with endoscopic placement of a plastic esophageal prosthesis, but this device has a high rate of complications. A new alternative is a metal-mesh stent that collapses to 3 mm in diameter at placement but can then expand up to 16 mm. METHODS: Patients with esophageal carcinoma (39 patients) or malignant extrinsic obstruction (3 patients) were randomly assigned to treatment with either a plastic prosthesis (16 mm in diameter) or an expansile metal-mesh stent. The patients were evaluated every six weeks until death. The degree of palliation was expressed as a dysphagia score and a Karnofsky performance score. RESULTS: Complications were significantly less frequent with the metal stents than with the plastic prostheses (no complications vs. nine; P {$<$} 0.001). The dysphagia and Karnofsky scores improved significantly and to a similar degree in both treatment groups. The most common causes of recurrent dysphagia were migration of the plastic prostheses (five patients) and ingrowth or overgrowth of the metal stents by tumor (five patients). The rates of reintervention were similar in both treatment groups, as were the 30-day mortality rates. The period of hospitalization after placement of a prosthesis was significantly longer in the group given plastic prostheses than in the group given metal stents (mean +/- SE, 12.5 +/- 2.1 vs. 5.4 +/- 1.0 days; P = 0.005). Despite their higher initial cost, the metal stents were cost effective because of the absence of fatal complications and the decrease in the hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS: Expansile metal stents are a safe and cost-effective alternative to conventional plastic endoprostheses in the treatment of esophageal obstruction due to inoperable cancer.},

The outcomes of interest were lack of specialist cancer consultation (surgeon, medical oncology, or radiation oncology) within 12 months of diagnosis. Association of age with lack of specialist cancer consultation was examined using Poisson regression modeling. RESULTS: Of 21,849 older women, 2.4\% (n~=~517) did not have any specialist cancer consultation within 12 months of diagnosis; lack of any specialist cancer consultation increased with age (0.8\% for age 70-74~years, 1.3\% for age 75-79~years, 2.5\% for age 80-84~years, and 7.0\% for age {$\geq$} 85~years; p~{$<~$}0.001). The proportion of patients who did not have consultations with surgeons, medical oncologists, and radiation oncologists was 8.6\% (n~=~1888), 34.4\% (n~=~7510), and 24.7\% (n~=~5404), respectively. Older age group was independently associated with an increased likelihood of lacking any specialist consultation, as well as not receiving surgical and medical oncology consultations. CONCLUSION: More than one-third of women {$\geq$} 70~years of age with non-metastatic breast cancer did not have a consultation with a medical oncologist, with women aged {$\geq$} 85~years least likely to have a medical oncology consultation.},

In the pivotal Intergroup-0116 Phase III trial by Macdonald et all, adjuvant chemoradiotherapy improved both disease-free and overall survival in curatively resected patients with mainly gastric adenocarcinoma. We compared survival data for curatively resected patients with adeno-carcinoma solely at the gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ), treated with surgery alone or surgery and adjuvant chemoradio-therapy. METHODS: From 2003 to 2009, 211 patients underwent curative resection. Surgery alone was performed in 95 pa-tients and 116 patients received adjuvant therapy after resection. All patients underwent Lewis-Tanner operation with D1 node resection including coliac nodes (D1+). Informations about recurrence and death were collected from the Danish Cancer Register and the Central Death Register. Patients who died after experiencing severe complications after surgery were excluded from the survival analysis. Patients with T0N0 or T1N0 were also excluded because patients of this category were not given adjuvant therapy according to the Macdonald protocol. RESULTS: Patients with positive node status in the resected specimen, the 3-year disease-free survival after adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (n = 91) or surgery alone (n = 43) was 24\% and 37\%, respectively. Median time of survival was prolonged by 10 month in favour of those who received chemoradiotherapy. However, after controlling for the confounding effect of age and node status, only positive node status in the resected specimen had significant partial effect on survival. CONCLUSION: Chemoradiotherapy according to the Intergroup-0116 protocol might still be a reasonable option after curative resection in patients with GEJ adenocarcinomas and positive lymph node status, who did not receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy.},

Today, we deal with massive, multiple data streams and easy access to new tests, ideas, and capabilities to process them. Whereas in the past getting information for decision-making was a challenge, now, it is how to analyze, evaluate and prioritize all that is readily available through the multitude of data-collecting devices. Clinicians must become adept with the tools needed to deal with the era of big data, requiring a major change in how we learn to make decisions. Major change is often met with resistance and questions about value. A Learning Health System is an enabler to encourage the development of such tools and demonstrate value in improved decision-making. Methods We describe how we are developing a Biomedical Informatics program to help our medical institution's evolution as an academic Learning Health System, including strategy, training for house staff and examples of the role of informatics from operations to research. Results We described an array of learning health system implementations and educational programs to improve healthcare and prepare a cadre of physicians with basic information technology skills. The programs have been well accepted with, for example, increasing interest and enrollment in the educational programs. Conclusions We are now in an era when large volumes of a wide variety of data are readily available.

The advent of powerful analytics systems has changed the concept of evidence. Clinicians will have to develop the skills necessary to work in the era of big data. It is not reasonable to expect that all clinicians will also be data scientists. However, understanding the role of AI and predictive analytics, and how to apply them, will become progressively more important.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer are usually offered systemic chemotherapy as palliative treatment. A multivariate analysis was performed in order to identify predictors and their constellation that allow a valid prediction of the outcome in patients treated with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 3825 patients treated with 5-FU within 19 prospective randomised and three phase II trials were separated into learning (n = 2549) and validation (n = 1276) samples. Data were analysed by tree analysis using the recursive partition and amalgamation method (RECPAM). A predictor could only enter the RECPAM analysis if the number of patients with missing values was {$<$} 33.3\% within a node, and the minimal node size was set to 50 patients. Twenty-three potential predictors were grouped into subsets of laboratory variables (11 parameters), tumour-related variables (seven parameters) and clinical variables (five parameters). In the first step, tree analysis was performed separately for each predictor subset. The selected prognostic parameters of the resulting partial models (the 'winners') were entered into the general model. The classification rule from the data of the learning set was applied to the independent validation set. RESULTS: Winners of the subgroup analysis for laboratory variables were: platelets {$>$} or = 400 x 10(9)/l, alkaline phosphatase {$>$} or = 300 U/l, white blood cell (WBC) count {$>$} or = 10 x 10(9)/l and haemoglobin {$<$} 11 x 10(9)/l, and all predicted a worse outcome. Negative predictors within the subgroup of tumour parameters were: number of tumour sites more than one or more than two, presence of liver metastases or peritoneal carcinomatosis, which predicted a worse outcome. Furthermore, presence of lung metastases, a primary rectal cancer and presence of lymph node metastases all predicted a better outcome in the multivariate setting. Among the clinical parameters only performance status of ECOG 0 or 1 predicted better outcome. In the final regression tree, three risk groups could be identified: low risk group (n = 1111) with a median survival of 15 months for patients with ECOG 0/1 and only one tumour site; intermediate risk group (n = 904) with a median survival of 10.7 months for patients with ECOG 0/1 and more than one tumour site and alkaline phosphatase {$<$} 300 U/l or patients with ECOG {$>$} 1, WBC count {$<$} 10 x 10(9)/l and only one tumour site; high risk group (n = 534) with a median survival of 6.1 months for patients with ECOG 0/1 and more than one tumour site and alkaline phosphatase of {$>$} or = 300 U/l or patients with ECOG {$>$} 1 and more than one tumour site or WBC count {$>$} 10 x 10(9)/l. The median survival times for the good, intermediate and high risk groups in the validation sample were 14.7, 10.5 and 6.4 months, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Patients can be divided into at least three risk groups depending on the four baseline clinical parameters: performance status, WBC count, alkaline phosphatase and number of metastatic sites. Any molecular or biological marker should be validated against these clinical parameters and decisions for more or less intensive treatments may be studied separately in these three risk groups. Also, clinical trials should be stratified according to the three risk groups.},

  abstract = {Enteral nutrition has been reported to be safe and effective in malnourished patients undergoing upper gastrointestinal surgery. In this study, we devised night home enteral nutrition (N-HEN) as a novel nutritional strategy and evaluated the efficacy in gastric cancer patients following total gastrectomy. Between January 2017 and March 2021, 24 patients were prospectively included in the protocol and supported by N-HEN for three postoperative months through a jejunostomy during the night (Elental:1200~kcal/day), and 22 patients without N-HEN were followed as a control group (CG). Body weight loss, nutritional indicators and tolerance to chemotherapy were evaluated. After 3 and 6~months, patients with N-HEN had significantly less body weight loss than CG (3~months P\,\&lt;\,0.0001: N-HEN 4.0\% vs. CG 15.2\%, 6~months P\,\&lt;\,0.0001: N-HEN 7.7\% vs. CG 17.7\%). Prealbumin was significantly higher in patients with N-HEN than CG after 3 and 6~months (3~months P\,\&lt;\,0.0001, 6~months P\,=\,0.0037). Albumin, total protein and hemoglobin, tended to be higher after 3 and 6~months in patients with N-HEN than CG, and total cholesterol after 6~months. Concerning the tolerance to adjuvant chemotherapy in Stage II-III patients, patients with N-HEN significantly had a higher completion rate (P\,=\,0.0420: N-HEN 70\% vs. CG 29\%) and longer duration (P\,=\,0.0313: N-HEN 458~days vs. CG 261~days) as planned. Continuous monitoring of blood glucose concentration in patients with N-HEN did not show nocturnal hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. N-HEN could be a novel enforced and physiologically effective nutritional strategy to support potentially malnourished patients following total gastrectomy.},

Research Question What is the prevalence and impact of frailty in patients with lung cancer? Study Design and Methods This systematic review and meta-analysis used a combination of free-text terms and medical subject headings terms, according to the database requirements in MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Library from inception until November 15,~2020. Results A total of 2,571 articles were identified, and 16 articles involving 4,183 patients were included for study. The prevalence of frailty in lung cancer was 45\%~(95\%~CI, 28-61; I2~= 99.5\%; P~{$<$} .0001). In patients with lung cancer, frailty was associated with an increased hazard ratio for mortality (hazard ratio, 3.01; 95\%~CI, 1.77-5.10; P~{$<$} .001). Interpretation The prevalence of frailty in lung cancer is 45\%, which has a significant negative impact on survival of patients with lung cancer. These results highlight the importance of measuring frailty, which provides important prognostic information, and may provide opportunities for interventions to improve outcomes in patients with lung cancer.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients often experience severe weight loss after oesophagectomy. Enteral nutrition via a feeding jejunostomy tube (FT) is commonly practised. This study aimed to assess the effect of severe weight loss postoperatively and enteral nutrition via an FT on long-term prognosis after oesophagectomy. METHODS: This study analysed 317 patients who underwent minimally invasive oesophagectomy at Kobe University Hospital and Hyogo Cancer Center from 2010 to 2015. The patients' body weight was evaluated at 3~months postoperatively. They were organised into the severe weight loss (n\,=\,65) and moderate weight loss (n\,=\,252) groups. Furthermore, they were categorised into the FT group (184 patients who had an FT placed during oesophagectomy) and no-FT group (133 patients without FT). Patients (119 per group) matched for the FT and no-FT groups were identified via propensity score matching. RESULTS: The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate in the severe weight loss group was significantly lower (p\,=\,0.024). In the multivariate analysis, tumour invasion depth (pT3-4), preoperative therapy and severe weight loss had a worse OS (hazard ratio\,=\,1.89; 95\% confidence interval\,=\,1.12-3.17, hazard ratio\,=\,2.11; 95\% confidence interval\,=\,1.25-3.54, hazard ratio\,=\,1.82; 95\% confidence interval\,=\,1.02-3.524, respectively). No significant differences in the number of severe weight loss patients and OS were found between the FT and no-FT groups. CONCLUSION: Severe weight loss is significantly associated with poor OS. In addition, enteral nutrition via an FT did not improve the severe weight loss and OS.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Clinical trials, which led to the approval of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), have been almost exclusively performed in patients with good Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS of 0-1). However, ICI remains an attractive option for patients with advanced tumors and poor PS. We hypothesized that patients with ECOG PS {$\geq$} 2 would have worse outcomes with ICI. METHODS: We retrospectively identified patients with advanced solid tumors who were treated with ICI at our institution. The log-rank test compared the survival among patients with different ECOG PS. We used a proportional hazards model to assess association between ECOG PS and overall survival (OS) with adjustment for covariates including age, sex, malignancy type, time from advance disease diagnosis, and line of therapy. We compared overall response rates between groups with Pearson chi-square exact test. We also analyzed in-hospital mortality and hospice referral rates. RESULTS: We identified 257 patients treated with ICI. One hundred eighty-two patients had ECOG PS 0-1, and 75 had ECOG PS {$\geq$} 2. The median overall survival was 12.6 months for the ECOG PS 0-1 group compared with 3.1 months for the ECOG PS {$\geq$} 2 group (P {$<$} .001). The overall response rate for patients with ECOG PS 0-1 was 23\% compared with 8\% for those with poor PS (P = .005). Patients with poor PS treated with ICI had similar hospice referral rates (67\% for ECOG PS {$\geq$} 2 v 61.9\% for ECOG PS 0-1, P = .50) but were more likely to have in-hospital death as compared with the good PS group (28.6\% v 15.1\%, P = .035). CONCLUSION: Despite the appeal of ICI in patients with advanced malignancy and poor PS, outcomes in this cohort were poor. Prospective trials defining the activity and role of ICI in poor PS are urgently needed.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Low skeletal muscle radiodensity (SMD) is related to higher mortality in several cancers, but the association with colorectal cancer (CRC) prognosis is unclear. METHODS: This observational study included 3262 men and women from the Kaiser Permanente Northern California population diagnosed between 2006 and 2011 with AJCC stages I to III CRC. The authors evaluated hazard ratios (HRs) of low SMD for all-cause and CRC-specific mortality, assessed by computed tomography using optimal stratification, compared with patients with normal SMD. They also evaluated the cross-classification of categories of low versus normal SMD and muscle mass (MM) with outcomes. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 6.9 years. Optimal stratification cutpoints for SMD were 32.5 in women and 35.5 in men. In multivariate-adjusted analyses, among patients with CRC, those with low SMD demonstrated higher overall (HR, 1.61; 95\% confidence interval [95\% CI], 1.36-1.90) and CRC-specific (HR, 1.74; 95\% CI, 1.38-2.21) mortality when compared with those with normal SMD levels. Patients with low SMD and low MM (ie, sarcopenia) were found to have the highest overall (HR, 2.02; 95\% CI, 1.65-2.47) and CRC-specific (HR, 2.54; 95\% CI, 1.91-3.37) mortality rates. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with CRC, those with low SMD were found to have elevated risks of disease-specific and overall mortality, independent of MM or adiposity.

METHODS: In total, 336 patients with esophageal cancer who underwent surgery between January 2011 and April 2017 were included in this study. We investigated the relationship between the CCI and postoperative nutrition indexes. RESULTS: Patients were divided into two groups: CCI {$\leq$}1 (low CCI group) and CCI {$\geq$}2 (high CCI group). A high CCI was significantly associated with shortened overall survival (OS; 3-year OS rate of 77.9\% in the low CCI group versus 59.7\% in the high CCI group; p~=~0.008). Nutritional indexes, such as the Prognostic Nutritional Index (PNI), at 1~month after esophagectomy were significantly lower in the high CCI group than in the low CCI group (p~=~0.031); however, the PNI at 6 months after surgery was similar between the high and low CCI groups. Multivariate analysis identified high CCI as an independent risk factor associated with PNI {$<$}45 in esophageal cancer patients at 1 month after esophagectomy (p~=~0.047). CONCLUSION: This study showed that CCI {$\geq$}2 was significantly associated with poor PNI at 1 month after surgery for esophageal cancer, indicating that it is necessary to administer effective nutritional interventions for patients with postoperative malnutrition, especially those with multiple comorbidities.},

The study comprised 107 subjects examined in the Swedish CArdioPulmonary BioImage Study (SCAPIS) using a 3-slice CT protocol covering liver, abdomen, and thighs. Algorithms were developed for automated assessment of liver attenuation, visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous (SAT) abdominal adipose tissue, thigh muscles, subcutaneous, subfascial (SFAT) and intermuscular adipose tissue. These were validated using manual reference measurements. SFAT was studied in selected subjects were the fascia lata could be visually identified (approx. 5\%). In addition, precision of manual measurements of intra- (IPAT) and retroperitoneal adipose tissue (RPAT) and deep- and superficial SAT was evaluated using repeated measurements. Automated measurements correlated strongly to manual reference measurements. The SFAT depot showed the weakest correlation (r\,=\,0.744). Automated VAT and SAT measurements were slightly, but significantly overestimated ({$\leq$}4.6\%, p\,{$\leq$}\,0.001). Manual segmentation of abdominal sub-depots showed high repeatability (CV\,{$\leq$}\,8.1\%, r\,{$\geq$}\,0.930).

Women with stage IIIC/IV EOC who underwent PDS with curative intent between 1/1/2006 and 12/ 31/2012 were included. Patient variables and vital status were abstracted. Body composition was evaluated in a semi-automated process using Slice-O-Matic software v4.3 (TomoVision). Skeletal muscle area and mean skeletal muscle attenuation were recorded. Associations with overall survival were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models and recursive partitioning. Results. We identified 296 patients and 132 (44.6\%) were classified as sarcopenic. The average mean skeletal muscle attenuation of the entire cohort was 33.4 Hounsfield units (HU). A multivariate model of overall risk of death included histology, residual disease, and mean skeletal attenuation. Among patients without residual disease, overall survival, but not progression free survival was significantly different between patients with low versus high mean skeletal attenuation (median survival, 2.8 vs. 3.3 years). Among patients with residual disease, overall survival was significantly different between patients with low versus high mean skeletal attenuation {$\geq$}36.40 vs. b36.40 HU (median survival, 2.0 vs. 3.3 years). Conclusions. Sarcopenia and low mean skeletal muscle attenuation are common in women undergoing PDS for advanced EOC. These factors are associated with poorer outcomes, and can be used in preoperative risk stratification and patient counseling. Further research into body composition and whether this risk factor can be altered via nutrition or fitness in this population is warranted.},

On the other hand, sarcopenia is one of the important prognostic factors of pancreatic cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of sarcopenia on overall survival (OS) and time to treatment failure (TTF) in patients with pancreatic cancer who received FOLFIRINOX. Methods Clinical data of consecutive patients treated with FOLFIRINOX at our institution from 2011 to 2017 was retrospectively reviewed. Skeletal muscle index (SMI) and adipose tissue index (ATI) at the third lumbar spine level was calculated from computed tomography (CT) images. The association between clinical factors (SMI and ATI), and OS and TTF were determined using univariate and multivariate analyses. Results We assessed 82 patients. The median OS of sarcopenia and the non-sarcopenia patients were 11.3 and 17.0 months, respectively (hazard ratio [HR], 2.49; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.43\textendash 4.32; p\,=\,0.001). Median TTF was 3.0 and 6.1 months in the sarcopenia and the non-sarcopenia patients, respectively (HR, 1.67; 95\% CI, 1.03\textendash 2.71; p\,=\,0.032). Multivariate analyses revealed that sarcopenia (HR, 1.37; 95\% CI, 1.01\textendash 1.87; p\,=\,0.045) was an independent prognostic factor of OS. High ATI (p\,=\,0.022) and sarcopenic obesity (p\,=\,0.008) were significantly associated with hematologic toxicity. Conclusions Sarcopenia is an independent indicator of poor prognosis in patients with pancreatic cancer who received FOLFIRINOX, while ATI and sarcopenic obesity predicted severe hematologic toxicity.},

The prognostic impact of SMI changes during consecutive palliative systemic treatments is unknown. METHODS: This is a~retrospective analysis~of the phase 3 CAIRO3 study. The CAIRO3 study randomized 557 patients between maintenance capecitabine~+~bevacizumab (CAP-B) or observation, after six cycles capecitabine~+~oxaliplatin~+~bevacizumab (CAPOX-B). Upon first disease progression (PD1), CAPOX-B was reintroduced until second progression (PD2). SMI was assessed by computed tomography (CT) (total 1355 scans). SMI and body mass index (BMI) changes were analyzed for three time-periods; p1: during initial CAPOX-B, p2: randomization to PD1, and p3: PD1 to PD2. The association between absolute and change in SMI and BMI (both per 1 standard deviation) during p1-p3, with PD1, PD2, and survival was studied by Cox regression models. RESULTS: This analysis included 450 of the 557 patients randomized in the CAIRO3 study. Mean SMI decreased during p1: mean -0.6 SMI units [95\% CI -1.07;-0.26] and p3: -2.2 units [-2.7;-1.8], whereas during p2, SMI increased~+~1.2 units [0.8-1.6]. BMI changes did not reflect changes in SMI. SMI loss during p2 and p3 was significantly associated with shorter survival (HR 1.19 [1.09-1.35]; 1.54 [1.31-1.79], respectively). Sarcopenia at PD1 was significantly associated with early PD2 (HR 1.40 [1.10-1.70]). BMI loss independent of SMI loss was only associated with shorter overall survival during p3 (HR 1.35 [1.14-1.63]). CONCLUSIONS: In mCRC patients, SMI loss during palliative systemic treatment was related with early disease progression and reduced survival. BMI did not reflect changes in SMI and could not identify patients at risk of poor outcome during early treatment lines.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence suggests that severe skeletal muscle index (SMI) loss (sarcopenia) is associated with poor overall survival in metastatic colorectal cancer patients, but its mechanisms are unknown. We recently found, using data of the randomized phase 3 CAIRO3 study, that SMI loss was related with shorter time to disease progression and overall survival during first-line maintenance treatment with capecitabine~+~bevacizumab (CAP-B) or observation and during more intensive capecitabine~+~oxaliplatin~+~bevacizumab (CAPOX-B) reintroduction treatment. As a potential risk factor for reduced survival, we explored whether sarcopenia and SMI loss were associated with dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) during CAP-B and CAPOX-B. METHODS: Sarcopenia status and SMI loss were assessed by using consecutive computed tomography scans. DLTs were defined as any dose delay/reduction/discontinuation of systemic treatment because of reported CTCAE (version 3.0) toxicities at the start or during treatment. Poisson regression models were used to study whether sarcopenia and body mass index (BMI) at the start of treatment and SMI and BMI loss during treatment were associated with DLTs. RESULTS: One hundred eighty-two patients (mean age 63.0~{$\pm~$}8.8~years, 37\% female) received CAP-B, and 232 patients (mean age 63.0~{$\pm~$}9.0~years, 34\% female) received CAPOX-B. At the start of CAP-B and CAPOX-B, 54\% and 46\% of patients were sarcopenic, respectively. Mean BMI was lower in sarcopenic patients, although patients were on average still overweight (sarcopenic vs. non-sarcopenic at the start of CAP-B 25.0~{$\pm~$}3.9 vs. 26.7~{$\pm~$}4.1 and CAPOX-B 25.8~{$\pm~$}3.8 vs. 27.1~{$\pm~$}3.8~kg/m2 ). Sarcopenia at the start of CAP-B was not associated with DLTs [relative risk 0.87 (95\% confidence interval 0.64-1.19)], whereas patients with {$>$}2\% SMI loss had a significantly higher risk of DLTs [1.29 (1.01-1.66)]. At the start of subsequent CAPOX-B, 25\% of patients received a dose reduction, and the risk of dose reduction was significantly higher for patients with preceding SMI loss [1.78 (1.06-3.01)] or sarcopenia [1.75 (1.08-2.86)]. After the received dose reductions, sarcopenia or SMI loss was not significantly associated with a higher risk of DLTs during CAPOX-B [sarcopenia vs. non-sarcopenic: 0.86 (0.69-1.08) and SMI loss vs. stable/gain: 0.83 (0.65-1.07)]. In contrast, BMI (loss) at the start or during either treatment was not associated with an increased risk of DLTs. CONCLUSIONS: In this large longitudinal study in metastatic colorectal cancer patients during palliative systemic treatment, sarcopenia and/or muscle loss was associated with an increased risk of DLTs. BMI was not associated with DLTs and could not detect sarcopenia or SMI loss. Prospective (randomized) studies should reveal whether normalizing chemotherapeutic doses to muscle mass or muscle mass preservation (by exercise and nutritional interventions) increases chemotherapeutic tolerance and improves survival.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Observational studies suggest that loss of skeletal muscle mass (SMM) is associated with chemotherapy-related toxicity, poor quality of life, and poor survival in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients. Little is known about the evolution of SMM during palliative systemic therapy. We investigated changes in SMM during various consecutive palliative systemic treatment regimens using repeated abdominal computed tomography scans of mCRC patients who participated in the randomized phase 3 CAIRO3 study. METHODS: In the CAIRO3 study, mCRC patients with stable disease or better after 6~cycles of first-line treatment with capecitabine~+~oxaliplatin~+~bevacizumab (CAPOX-B) were randomized between maintenance treatment with capecitabine~+~bevacizumab (CAP-B) or observation. Upon first disease progression, in both groups, CAPOX-B or other treatment was reintroduced until the second disease progression, which was the primary study endpoint. We analysed 1355 computed tomography scans of 450 (81\%) CAIRO3 patients (64~{$\pm~$}9.0~years, CAP-B n~=~223; observation n~=~227) for SMM at four time points (i.e. prior to the start of pre-randomization initial treatment, at randomization, and at first and at second disease progression) using the Slice-o-matic software and single slice evaluation at the lumbar 3 level. By using accepted and widely used formulas, whole body SMM was calculated. A linear mixed effects model, adjusted for relevant confounders, was used to assess SMM changes for the total group and within and between study arms. RESULTS: During 6~cycles of initial treatment with CAPOX-B prior to randomization, SMM decreased significantly in all patients [CAP-B arm: -0.53~kg (95\% CI -1.12; -0.07) and observation arm: -0.85~kg (-1.45; -0.25)]. After randomization, SMM recovered during CAP-B treatment by 1.32~kg (0.73; 1.90) and observation by 1.20~kg (0.63; 1.78) (median time from randomization to first disease progression 8.6 and 4.1~months for CAP-B arm and observation arm, respectively). After first progression and during reintroduction treatment with CAPOX-B or other treatment, SMM again decreased significantly and comparable in both arms, CAP-B: -2.71~kg (-3.37; -2.03), and observation: -2.01~kg (-2.64; -1.41) (median time from first progression until second progression CAP-B arm: 4.7~months and observation arm: 6.6~months). CONCLUSIONS: This longitudinal study provides a unique insight in SMM changes in mCRC patients during palliative systemic treatment regimens, including observation. Our data show that muscle loss is reversible and may be influenced by the intensity of systemic regimens. Although studies have shown prognostic capacity for SMM, the effects of subsequent changes in SMM are unknown and may be clues for new future therapeutic interventions.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Iron supplementation and erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) administration represent the hallmark therapies in preoperative anemia treatment, as reflected in a set of evidence-based treatment recommendations made during the 2018 International Consensus Conference on Patient Blood Management. However, little is known about the safety of these therapies. This systematic review investigated the occurrence of adverse events (AEs) during or after treatment with iron and/or ESAs. METHODS: Five databases (The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, Transfusion Evidence Library, Web of Science) and two trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP) were searched until 23 May 2022. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort, and case-control studies investigating any AE during or after iron and/or ESA administration in adult elective surgery patients with preoperative anemia were eligible for inclusion and judged using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tools. The GRADE approach was used to assess the overall certainty of evidence. RESULTS: Data from 26 RCTs and 16 cohort studies involving a total of 6062 patients were extracted, on 6 treatment comparisons: (1) intravenous (IV) versus oral iron, (2) IV iron versus usual care/no iron, (3) IV ferric carboxymaltose versus IV iron sucrose, (4) ESA+iron versus control (placebo and/or iron, no treatment), (5) ESA+IV iron versus ESA+oral iron, and (6) ESA+IV iron versus ESA+IV iron (different ESA dosing regimens). Most AE data concerned mortality/survival (n=24 studies), thromboembolic (n=22), infectious (n=20), cardiovascular (n=19) and gastrointestinal (n=14) AEs. Very low certainty evidence was assigned to all but one outcome category. This uncertainty results from both the low quantity and quality of AE data due to the high risk of bias caused by limitations in the study design, data collection, and reporting. CONCLUSIONS: It remains unclear if ESA and/or iron therapy is associated with AEs in preoperatively anemic elective surgery patients. Future trial investigators should pay more attention to the systematic collection, measurement, documentation, and reporting of AE data.},

  abstract = {Sarcopenia, the reduction of muscle mass and strength that occurs with aging, is widely considered one of the major causes of disability in older persons. Surprisingly, criteria that may help a clinician to identify persons with impaired muscle function are still lacking. Using data from a large representative sample of the general population, we examined how muscle function and calf muscle area change with aging and affect mobility in men and women free of neurological conditions. We tested several putative indicators of sarcopenia, including knee extension isometric torque, handgrip, lower extremity muscle power, and calf muscle area. For each indicator, sarcopenia was considered to be present when the measure was {$>$}2 SDs below the mean. For all four measures, the prevalence of sarcopenia increased with age, both in men and women. The age-associated gradient in prevalence was maximum for muscle power and minimum for calf-muscle area. However, lower extremity muscle power was no better than knee-extension torque or handgrip in the early identification of poor mobility, defined either as walking speed {$<$}0.8 m/s or inability to walk at least 1 km without difficulty and without developing symptoms. Optimal cutoff values that can be used in the clinical practice to identify older persons with poor mobility were developed. The findings of the study lay the basis for a cost-effective, clinical marker of sarcopenia based on a measure of isometric handgrip strength. Our findings should be verified in a longitudinal study.},

  abstract = {A series of 1,314 cases of advanced measurable colon or rectal cancer were evaluated for objective tumor response and survival. All patients received chemotherapy according to protocols conducted by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group during the period between 1974 and 1977. For those patients who had not received chemotherapy prior to study entry, no therapy program under evaluations was significantly more active than the oral or intravenous 5-fluorouracil treatment programs with respect to survival or objective tumor response. The survival and response rates therapy programs under study, including methyl-CCNU, appeared to be comparable. Initial performance status (P {$<$} 0.01), weight loss in the six months prior to study entry (P {$<$} 0.001), and prior chemotherapy status were shown to be most prognostic for survival, and thus merit inclusion as stratification factors in any comparative trial involving this population. These factors were shown to have a cumulatively greater influence upon survival than the treatment program. Treatment differences were most accentuated within the favorable subgroups of the leading prognostic factors. The location of the primary tumor had a significant effect upon the eventual sites of metastatic disease involvement at the time of study entry (P {$<$} 0.001). The consequences of this analysis suggest that investigators need to address characteristics of the population under study. It is also noted that patients with chemotherapy prior to study entry are best suited for survival studies, while patients with no chemotherapy prior to study entry are well suited for both objective tumor response and survival studies.},

Exercise has long been suggested as a treatment to combat sarcopenia and dynapenia, as it exerts effects on both the nervous and muscular systems that are critical to positive physiological and functional adaptations (e.g., enhanced muscle strength). For more than two decades scientists have recognized the profound role that progressive resistance exercise training can have on increasing muscle strength, muscle size and functional capacity in older adults. In this review article we discuss how resistance exercise training can be used in the management and prevention of sarcopenia and dynapenia. We first provide an overview of the evidence for this notion and highlight certain critical factors- namely exercise intensity, volume and progression- that are key to optimizing the resistance exercise prescription. We then highlight how many, if not most, of the commonly prescribed exercise programs for seniors are not the 'best practices', and subsequently present easy-to-read guidelines for a well-rounded resistance exercise training program designed for the management and prevention of sarcopenia and dynapenia, including example training programs for the beginner through the advanced senior resistance exerciser. These guidelines have been written for the academician as well as the student and health care provider across a variety of disciplines, including those in the long term care industry, such as wellness instructors or activity directors.},

This trial was designed to compare postoperative treatment with capecitabine plus cisplatin (XP) versus XP plus radiotherapy with capecitabine (XP/XRT/XP). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The XP arm received six cycles of XP (capecitabine 2,000 mg/m2 per day on days 1 to 14 and cisplatin 60 mg/m2 on day 1, repeated every 3 weeks) chemotherapy. The XP/XRT/XP arm received two cycles of XP followed by 45-Gy XRT (capecitabine 1,650 mg/m2 per day for 5 weeks) and two cycles of XP. RESULTS: Of 458 patients, 228 were randomly assigned to the XP arm and 230 to the XP/XRT/XP arm. Treatment was completed as planned by 75.4\% of patients (172 of 228) in the XP arm and 81.7\% (188 of 230) in the XP/XRT/XP arm. Overall, the addition of XRT to XP chemotherapy did not significantly prolong disease-free survival (DFS; P = .0862). However, in the subgroup of patients with pathologic lymph node metastasis at the time of surgery (n = 396), patients randomly assigned to the XP/XRT/XP arm experienced superior DFS when compared with those who received XP alone (P = .0365), and the statistical significance was retained at multivariate analysis (estimated hazard ratio, 0.6865; 95\% CI, 0.4735 to 0.9952; P = .0471). CONCLUSION The addition of XRT to XP chemotherapy did not significantly reduce recurrence after curative resection and D2 lymph node dissection in gastric cancer. A subsequent trial (ARTIST-II) in patients with lymph node-positive gastric cancer is planned.},

  abstract = {Pretreatment risk stratification is key for personalized medicine. While many physicians rely on an "eyeball test" to assess whether patients will tolerate major surgery or chemotherapy, "eyeballing" is inherently subjective and difficult to quantify. The concept of morphometric age derived from cross-sectional imaging has been found to correlate well with outcomes such as length of stay, morbidity, and mortality. However, the determination of the morphometric age is time intensive and requires highly trained experts. In this study, we propose a fully automated deep learning system for the segmentation of skeletal muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) on an axial computed tomography image taken at the third lumbar vertebra. We utilized a fully automated deep segmentation model derived from an extended implementation of a fully convolutional network with weight initialization of an ImageNet pre-trained model, followed by post processing to eliminate intramuscular fat for a more accurate analysis. This experiment was conducted by varying window level (WL), window width (WW), and bit resolutions in order to better understand the effects of the parameters on the model performance. Our best model, fine-tuned on 250 training images and ground truth labels, achieves 0.93~{$\pm~$}0.02 Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and 3.68~{$\pm~$}2.29\% difference between predicted and ground truth muscle CSA on 150 held-out test cases. Ultimately, the fully automated segmentation system can be embedded into the clinical environment to accelerate the quantification of muscle and expanded to volume analysis of 3D datasets.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Pathologic complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant therapy for locally advanced esophageal adenocarcinoma is associated with improved survival. The Southwest Oncology Group designed a trimodality, phase II, single-arm trial with objectives of achieving a pCR rate of 40\% with prospective exploratory analyses of intratumoral molecular markers postulated to affect response and survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with clinically staged II or III esophageal adenocarcinoma received oxaliplatin 85 mg/m(2) on days 1, 15, and 29; protracted-infusion fluorouracil (PI-FU) 180 mg/m(2)/d on days 8 through 43; and external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT) 5 days a week at 1.8 Gy/d for 25 fractions; surgery was performed 28 to 42 days after neoadjuvant therapy. Chemotherapy was planned after surgery. Tumors were analyzed for mRNA expression and polymorphisms in genes involved in drug metabolism and DNA repair. RESULTS: Ninety-three patients were evaluable. Two deaths (2.2\%) were attributable to preoperative therapy, and two deaths (2.2\%) were attributable to surgery. Grade 3 and 4 toxicities were recorded for 47.3\% and 19.4\% of patients, respectively. Seventy-nine patients (84.9\%) underwent surgery; 67.7\% of patients had R0 resections. Twenty-six patients (28.0\%) had confirmed pCR (95\% CI, 19.1\% to 38.2\%). At a median follow-up of 39.2 months, estimates of median and 3-year overall survival (OS) were 28.3 months and 45.1\%, respectively. Intratumoral ERCC-1 gene expression was inversely related to progression-free survival and OS. CONCLUSION: Neoadjuvant oxaliplatin, PI-FU, and EBRT for esophageal adenocarcinoma is active and tolerable. Because the regimen failed to meet the primary end point, it does not define a new standard. However, future trials can be built on this platform to validate the role of ERCC-1 in determining the best systemic regimen for individual patients.},

  abstract = {RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The automated segmentation of organs and tissues throughout the body using computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging has been rapidly increasing. Research into many medical conditions has benefited greatly from these approaches by allowing the development of more rapid and reproducible quantitative imaging markers. These markers have been used to help diagnose disease, determine prognosis, select patients for therapy, and follow responses to therapy. Because some of these tools are now transitioning from research environments to clinical practice, it is important for radiologists to become familiar with various methods used for automated segmentation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Radiology Research Alliance of the Association of University Radiologists convened an Automated Segmentation Task Force to conduct a systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature on this topic. RESULTS: The systematic review presented here includes 408 studies and discusses various approaches to automated segmentation using computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging for neurologic, thoracic, abdominal, musculoskeletal, and breast imaging applications. CONCLUSION: These insights should help prepare radiologists to better evaluate automated segmentation tools and apply them not only to research, but eventually to clinical practice.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Muscle metrics derived from computed tomography (CT) are associated with adverse health events in older persons, but obtaining these metrics using current methods is not practical for large datasets. We developed a fully automated method for muscle measurement on CT images. This study aimed to determine the relationship between muscle measurements on CT with survival in a large multicenter trial of older adults. METHOD: The relationship between baseline paraspinous skeletal muscle area (SMA) and skeletal muscle density (SMD) and survival over 6 years was determined in 6,803 men and 4,558 women (baseline age: 60-69 years) in the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST). The automated machine learning pipeline selected appropriate CT series, chose a single image at T12, and segmented left paraspinous muscle, recording cross-sectional area and density. Associations between SMA and SMD with all-cause mortality were determined using sex-stratified Cox proportional hazards models, adjusted for age, race, height, weight, pack-years of smoking, and presence of diabetes, chronic lung disease, cardiovascular disease, and cancer at enrollment. RESULTS: After a mean 6.44 {$\pm$} 1.06 years of follow-up, 635 (9.33\%) men and 265 (5.81\%) women died. In men, higher SMA and SMD were associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality, in fully adjusted models. A one-unit standard deviation increase was associated with a hazard ratio (HR) = 0.85 (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 0.79, 0.91; p {$<$} .001) for SMA and HR = 0.91 (95\% CI = 0.84, 0.98; p = .012) for SMD. In women, the associations did not reach significance. CONCLUSION: Higher paraspinous SMA and SMD, automatically derived from CT exams, were associated with better survival in a large multicenter cohort of community-dwelling older men.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cancer cachexia-associated weight loss is poorly understood; energetically demanding tissues (eg, organ and tumor mass) and resting energy expenditure (REE) are reported to increase with advanced cancer. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to quantify the potential contribution of increasing masses of energetically demanding tissues to REE with colorectal cancer cachexia progression. DESIGN: A longitudinal computed tomography (CT) image review was performed to quantify organ size (liver, including metastases, and spleen) and peripheral tissues (skeletal muscle and adipose tissue) during colorectal cancer cachexia progression (n = 34). Body composition was prospectively evaluated by CT and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and REE was determined by indirect calorimetry in advanced colorectal cancer patients (n = 18). RESULTS: Eleven months from death, the liver (2.3 +/- 0.7 kg) and spleen (0.32 +/- 0.2 kg) were larger than reference values. One month from death, liver weight increased to 3.0 +/- 1.5 kg (P = 0.010), spleen showed a trend to increase (P = 0.077), and concurrent losses of muscle (4.2 kg) and fat (3.5 kg) (P {$<$} 0.05) were observed. The estimated percentage of fat-free mass (FFM) occupied by the liver increased from 4.5\% to 7.0\% (P {$<$} 0.001). The most rapid loss of peripheral tissues and liver and metastases gain occurred within 3 mo of death. A positive linear relation existed between liver mass and measured whole-body REE (r(2) = 0.35, P = 0.010); because liver accounted for a larger percentage of FFM, measured REE . kg FFM(-1) . d(-1) increased (r(2) = 0.35, P = 0.010). CONCLUSIONS: Increases in mass and in the proportion of high metabolic rate tissues, including liver and tumor, represented a cumulative incremental REE of approximately 17,700 kcal during the last 3 mo of life and may contribute substantially to cachexia-associated weight loss.},

METHODS: We tested whether sarcopenia predicts primary colorectal cancer resection outcomes in stage II-IV patients (n=234). Sarcopenia was assessed using preoperative computed tomography images. Administrative hospitalisation data encompassing the index surgical admission, direct transfers for inpatient rehabilitation care and hospital re-admissions within 30 days was searched for International Classification of Disease (ICD)-10 codes for postoperative infections and inpatient rehabilitation care and used to calculate length of stay (LOS). RESULTS: Overall, 38.9\% were sarcopenic; 16.7\% had an infection and 9.0\% had inpatient rehabilitation care. Length of stay was longer for sarcopenic patients overall (15.9 {$\pm$} 14.2 days vs 12.3 {$\pm$} 9.8 days, P=0.038) and especially in those {$\geq$} 65 years (20.2 {$\pm$} 16.9 days vs 13.1 {$\pm$} 8.3 days, P=0.008).

Approximately 50-80\% of patients with esophageal cancer are malnourished at the time of diagnosis. Malnutrition enhances the risk of postoperative complications, resulting in delay of postoperative recovery and impairment of quality of life. Sixty-five patients with esophageal cancer were included. All patients who received surgery (n = 28) in the time frame between March 2009 and April 2010, the first year after the start of INS, were included in the INS intervention group. The control group (n = 37) consisted of patients who received surgery during the 3 years before the start of INS. Logistic regression analysis was used to compare differences in severity of postoperative complications using the Dindo classification. Linear regression was applied to evaluate differences in preoperative weight change. The adjusted odds ratio for developing serious complications after surgery of INS compared with the control group was 0.23 (95\% confidence interval: 0.053-0.97; P = 0.045). Benefit was mainly observed in patients who received neoadjuvant therapy before esophagectomy (n = 35). The INS program furthermore resulted in a relative preoperative weight gain in comparison with the control group of +4.8\% (P = 0.009, adjusted) in these neoadjuvant-treated patients. This study shows that dietician-delivered INS preserves preoperative weight and decreases severe postoperative complications in patients with esophageal cancer.},

Sarcopenia, defined as the loss of muscle mass and function, is known to cause adverse health outcomes. The purpose of this umbrella review was to integrate published systematic reviews and meta-analyses exploring sarcopenia and lung cancer to provide comprehensive knowledge on their relationship. METHODS: Eligible studies were searched from scientific databases until June 28, 2022. Critical appraisal was performed using A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) 2. The impact of sarcopenia on the pathophysiology, prevalence, and prognosis of lung cancer is summarized at the level of systematic reviews or meta-analyses. RESULTS: Fourteen reviews and meta-analyses were conducted. The methodological quality was high for one review, low for nine, and critically low for four. The most common standard for diagnosing sarcopenia in the lung cancer population is computed tomography (CT) to measure the skeletal muscle index at the third lumbar vertebra (L3). Sarcopenia was highly prevalent among patients with lung cancer, with a pooled prevalence ranging from 42.8\% to 45.0\%. The association between sarcopenia and increased postoperative complications and decreased disease control rates with immune checkpoint inhibitors has been demonstrated. Mortality was significantly higher in sarcopenic patients than in non-sarcopenic patients with lung cancer, regardless of the stage of disease or type of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Sarcopenia is a poor prognostic factor for lung cancer. Future studies are necessary to clarify the pathophysiology of sarcopenia and develop effective interventions for sarcopenia in patients with lung cancer.},

It is unclear, however, whether the evidence in the literature supports their safety and efficacy in reducing perioperative red cell transfusions. Adhering to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines, we conducted a systematic review to evaluate their use in a variety of perioperative settings. We performed a literature search of English articles published between July 1997 and July 2012 in MEDLINE via PubMed, The Cochrane Library, and CINAHL. Only studies with a comparator group were eligible for inclusion. Twenty-four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 15 nonrandomized studies were included in the final review. Using the Cochrane risk of bias tool, 8 RCTs were assessed to be at low risk for methodological bias. Of these, however, only 4 RCTs were adequately powered to detect a reduction in transfusion rates. Patients with preoperative iron deficiency anemia may have an earlier and more robust hemoglobin recovery with preoperative IV iron therapy than with oral iron supplementation. A short preoperative regimen of EPO, or a single dose of EPO plus IV iron in the preoperative or intraoperative period, may significantly reduce transfusion rates (number needed to treat to avoid any transfusion ranged from 3 to 6). With regard to the safety of erythropoietin-stimulating agent therapy, IV iron appears to be as well tolerated as oral iron; however, the incidence of severe anaphylactic-type reactions attributable to IV iron is difficult to estimate in prospective trials because of its relatively infrequent occurrence. Furthermore, EPO may increase the risk of thromboembolism in spinal surgery patients who receive mechanical antithrombotic prophylaxis in the perioperative period so pharmacological thromboprophylaxis is advised. Future low risk of bias, adequately powered prospective efficacy, and safety trials in various surgical settings that traditionally require red cell transfusions would be required to make evidenced-based conclusions about the clinical significance of erythropoietin-stimulating agent as a transfusion avoidance strategy in perioperative blood management.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anastomotic leak after esophagectomy is a significant cause of morbidity. Perianastomotic drain amylase is accurate in detecting leaks, but it is unclear whether its accuracy is affected by comorbid conditions, anastomotic method, or anastomotic location. We hypothesized that drain amylase would accurately discriminate leak in a variety of settings. METHODS: We reviewed 290 consecutive patients undergoing esophagectomy with gastric conduit reconstruction. Patient comorbidities, operative variables, and drain amylase were collected. The diagnosis of a leak was based on the level of intervention required, and was characterized as clinically significant if it required wound opening or endoscopic or surgical intervention. Receiver-operating characteristic curves analysis was performed to determine the accuracy of amylase to detect leak for each patient variable. RESULTS: A total of 53 (18.3\%) of 290 esophagectomies had an anastomotic leak, of which 33 (11.4\%) of 290 were clinically significant. Drain amylase was a strong predictor of anastomotic leak on postoperative day (POD) 3 to POD 7, regardless of patient comorbidities, location of anastomosis, or technique of anastomosis, but was less accurate in the diagnosis of leak in current smokers (area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve, 0.530 vs 0.752; P~= .006). A maximum drain amylase value no higher than 35 on POD 3, POD 4, or POD 5 was 88\% sensitive in detecting leak at any point postoperatively. A value greater than or equal to 150 was 88\% specific in diagnosing leak. CONCLUSIONS: Drain amylase is a versatile method for early detection of anastomotic leaks. Its accuracy is unaffected by neoadjuvant treatment, location or type of anastomosis, or patient comorbidities but may be less accurate in active smokers.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine whether an intervention with smoking cessation starting 4 weeks before general and orthopedic surgery would reduce the frequency of postoperative complications. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Complications are a major concern after elective surgery and smokers have an increased risk. There is insufficient evidence concerning how the duration of preoperative smoking intervention affects postoperative complications. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial, conducted between February 2004 and December 2006 at 4 university-affiliated hospitals in the Stockholm region, Sweden. The outcome assessment was blinded. The follow-up period for the primary outcome was 30 days. Eligibility criteria were active daily smokers, aged 18 to 79 years. Of the 238 patients assessed, 76 refused participating, and 117 men and women undergoing surgery for primary hernia repair, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, or a hip or knee prosthesis were enrolled. INTERVENTION: Smoking cessation therapy with individual counseling and nicotine substitution started 4 weeks before surgery and continued 4 weeks postoperatively. The control group received standard care. The main outcome measure was frequency of any postoperative complication. RESULTS: An intention-to-treat analysis showed that the overall complication rate in the control group was 41\%, and in the intervention group, it was 21\% (P = 0.03). Relative risk reduction for the primary outcome of any postoperative complication was 49\% and number needed to treat was 5 (95\% CI, 3-40). An analysis per protocol showed that abstainers had fewer complications (15\%) than those who continued to smoke or only reduced smoking (35\%), although this difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Perioperative smoking cessation seems to be an effective tool to reduce postoperative complications even if it is introduced as late as 4 weeks before surgery.},

  abstract = {Purpose: The present study aimed to evaluate the oncologic outcomes of patients 80 years or older compared with younger patients, and we then further investigated the efficacy of chemotherapy in individuals 80 years or older. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted using the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database. The {$\chi$}2 test was used to analyze the different clinicopathologic and demographic variables between 65- and 79-year and {$\geq$}80-year groups. Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank testing were used to compare colorectal cancer (CRC)-specific survival (CCSS) curves between different groups. Multivariate and univariate Cox proportional hazards models with hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were also used to assess CCSS and OS. Results: A total of 189,926 patients were included in our study. Compared with 65- to 79-year-old patients, age 80 years or older was associated with 48.4\% increased CRC-specific mortality (HR = 1.484, 95\% CI = 1.453-1.516, P {$<$} 0.0001; using 65-79 years old as the reference). Moreover, not receiving chemotherapy was significantly associated with an increased risk of CRC-related death, independent of other prognostic factors (HR = 0.615, 95\% CI = 0.589-0.643, P {$<$} 0.0001) in individuals 80 years or older. Conclusions: This large population-based study showed that older age was associated with worse oncologic outcomes compared to younger age. Chemotherapy could offer survival benefit for very old patients diagnosed with CRC, and we strongly believed that very old patients were undertreated in the present medical practices.},

Esophagectomy has historically been associated with significant levels of morbidity and mortality and as a result routine application and audit of ERAS guidelines specifically designed for esophageal resection has significant potential to improve outcomes associated with this complex procedure. METHODS: A team of international experts in the surgical management of esophageal cancer was assembled and the existing literature was identified and reviewed prior to the production of the guidelines. Well established procedure specific components of ERAS were reviewed and updated with changes relevant to esophagectomy. Procedure specific, operative and technical sections were produced utilizing the best current level of evidence. All sections were rated regarding the level of evidence and overall recommendation according to the evaluation (GRADE) system. RESULTS: Thirty-nine sections were ultimately produced and assessed for quality of evidence and recommendations. Some sections were completely new to ERAS programs due to the fact that esophagectomy is the first guideline with a thoracic component to the procedure. CONCLUSIONS: The current ERAS society guidelines should be reviewed and applied in all centers looking to improve outcomes and quality associated with esophageal resection.},

OBJECTIVE: To characterize the age disparities among trial enrollees on randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of common cancers in clinical oncology and identify factors associated with wider age imbalances. DATA SOURCES: Phase 3 clinical oncology RCTs were identified through ClinicalTrials.gov. STUDY SELECTION: Multiarm RCTs assessing a therapeutic intervention for patients with breast, prostate, colorectal, or lung cancer (the 4 most common cancer disease sites) were included. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Trial data were extracted from ClinicalTrials.gov. Trial screening and parameter identification were independently performed by 2 individuals. Data were analyzed in 2018. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The difference in median age (DMA) between the trial participant median age and the population-based disease-site-specific median age was determined for each trial. RESULTS: Three hundred two trials met inclusion criteria. The trials collectively enrolled 262\,354 participants; 249 trials (82.5\%) were industry-funded. For all trials, the trial median age of trial participants was a mean of 6.49 years younger than the population median age (95\% CI, -7.17 to -5.81 years; P\,{$<$}\,.001). Age disparities were heightened among industry-funded trials compared with non-industry-funded trials (mean DMA, -6.84 vs -4.72 years; P\,=\,.002). Enrollment criteria restrictions based on performance status or age cutoffs were associated with age disparities; however, industry-funded trials were not more likely to use these enrollment restrictions than non-industry-funded trials. Age disparities were also larger among trials that evaluated a targeted systemic therapy and among lung cancer trials. Linear regression modeling revealed a widening gap between trial and population median ages over time at a rate of -0.19 years annually (95\% CI, -0.37 to -0.01 years; P\,=\,.04). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Age disparities between trial participants and the incident disease population are pervasive across trials and appear to be increasing over time. Industry sponsorship of trials is associated with heightened age imbalances among trial participants. With an increasing role of industry funding among cancer trials, efforts to understand and address age disparities are necessary to ensure generalizability of trial results as well as equity in trial access.},

ID frequently contributes to the pathogenesis of anemia in patients with cancer and may lead to several symptoms such as impaired physical function, weakness and fatigue. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Parameters of iron status and clinical parameters were evaluated in 1528 patients with cancer who presented consecutively within a four-month period at our center. One thousand fifty-three patients had solid tumors and 475 hematological malignancies. RESULTS: ID [transferrin saturation (TSAT) {$<$} 20\%] was noted in 645 (42.6\%) of the 1513 patients with TSAT tests available and 500 (33.0\%) were anemic. ID rates were highest in pancreatic (63.2\%), colorectal (51.9\%) and lung cancers (50.7\%). Of the 409 iron-deficient patients in whom serum ferritin levels were available additionally to TSAT, 335 (81.9\%) presented with functional ID (FID) (TSAT {$<$} 20\%, serum ferritin {$\geq$}30 ng/ml) and 74 (18.1\%) with absolute ID. In patients with solid tumors, prevalence of ID correlated with cancer stage at diagnosis (P = 0.001), disease status (P = 0.001) and ECOG performance status (P = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: ID was frequently noted in cancer and was associated with advanced disease, close proximity to cancer therapy, and poor performance status in patients with solid tumors.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the economic impact of intravenous iron (in the form of intravenous iron preparation of ferric carboxymaltose) in three different clinical settings of iron deficiency anemia: chemotherapy-induced anemia in breast cancer, chemotherapy-induced anemia in digestive cancer, and perioperative anemia in knee and hip surgery. METHODS: The economic model compared the usual therapeutic strategies of anemia without intravenous iron and strategies including intravenous iron, in each of the three clinical settings selected. Costs related to anemia treatment by erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA), blood transfusion, and intravenous iron were estimated and compared inside each setting. Cost savings were calculated from the French healthcare payer perspective. Data included in the economic model were obtained from scientific literature, public health agencies, and medical experts. RESULTS: The most prominent annual cost savings were observed in chemotherapy-induced anemia in breast cancer (\texteuro 997 and \texteuro 360 per patient for metastatic and non-metastatic breast cancers, respectively; global cost saving, \texteuro 33.6 million). This large impact of intravenous iron on costs was mainly explained by both a lower number of women treated and lower ESA dosing. Mean annual cost saving in digestive cancers and knee and hip surgery were estimated to \texteuro 168 and \texteuro 216 per patient and global cost savings of \texteuro 7.5 and \texteuro 12.1 million, respectively. Overall, annual cost savings in these three settings were estimated to \texteuro 53 million including \texteuro 39 million for ESA cost savings. Sensitivity analysis showed that strategies including intravenous iron remained cost-effective even with wide variations in the assumptions, particularly for cost savings on ESA. LIMITATIONS: Economic model based on literature data and expert opinions. CONCLUSIONS: The present economic model suggests that use of intravenous iron, according to recommendations of international guidelines, is cost saving, particularly in chemotherapy-induced anemia in breast cancers.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The safety and effectiveness of minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) in comparison with the open esophagectomy (OE) remain uncertain in esophageal cancer treatment. The purpose of this meta-analysis is to compare the outcomes of the two surgical modalities. METHODS: Searches were conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and ClinicalTrials.gov with the following index words: "esophageal cancer", "VATS", "MIE", "thoracoscopic esophagectomy", and "open esophagectomy" for relative studies that compared the effects between MIE and OE. Random-effect models were used, and heterogeneity was assessed. RESULTS: A total of 20 studies were included in the analysis, consisting of four randomized controlled trials and 16 prospective studies. MIE has reduced operative blood loss (P=0.0009) but increased operation time (P=0.009) in comparison with OE. Patients get less respiratory complications (risk ratio =0.74, 95\% CI =0.58-0.94, P=0.01) and better overall survival (hazard ratio =0.54, 95\% CI =0.42-0.70, P{$<$}0.00001) in the MIE group than the OE group. No statistical difference was observed between the two groups in terms of lymph node harvest, R0 resection, and other major complications. CONCLUSION: MIE is a better choice for esophageal cancer because patients undergoing MIE may benefit from reduced blood loss, less respiratory complications, and also improved overall survival condition compared with OE. However, more randomized controlled trials are still needed to verify these differences.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The optimal treatment for elderly patients with esophageal cancer (EC) remains controversial. In the present study, we aimed to investigate whether elderly patients with stage II-III EC could benefit from trimodal therapy. METHODS: The selected elderly patients with stage II-III EC between 2004 and 2015 were included in a retrospective cohort study from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. The patients were divided into two groups based on whether or not they underwent surgery. The inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) analysis was used to balance the confounding factors between the two groups. The Cox regression analysis, the log-rank test, and the Kaplan-Meier curves were conducted to identify the survival benefits of different treatment regimes. RESULTS: A total of 1596 patients were included in this cohort study, in which 278 patients underwent surgery. In the combination of chemoradiotherapy and surgery group, there were more male patients, more patients aged between 75 and 79~years, and more married patients in the surgery group. Moreover, there were more patients with adenomatous carcinoma, more patients with a tumor size of less than 5~cm, and more patients with a T3~stage in the combination group. In the survival analysis, patients in the combination group had a longer overall survival (OS) and EC-specific survival (ECSS). After IPTW analysis, the survival analysis generated similar results. The competitive risk model found that our results were stable. There was still a significant difference in OS and ECSS between the combination group and chemoradiotherapy alone group for esophageal adenocarcinoma (p~{$<~$}0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients with stage II-III EC, especially those with adenocarcinoma, could benefit from the combination of surgery and chemoradiotherapy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The oesophageal carcinoma patients show high incidence of malnutrition, which negatively affects their therapy outcome. Moreover, benefits of enteral nutrition remain to be studied in details in these patients. Therefore, we set to assess the effects of enteral nutrition on the nutritional status, treatment toxicities and survival in the oesophageal carcinoma patients treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eligible patients were randomly assigned to either the experimental or control group. The patients in the experimental group were treated with a whole-course enteral nutrition management, while the control group were provided a unsystematic nutrition without setting intake goals for energy and protein. The primary endpoint was a change in body weight, while the secondary endpoints included nutrition-related haematological indicators, toxicities, completion rate of treatment and survival. RESULTS: A total of 222 patients were randomised to either the experimental (n=148) or control (n=74) group. Patients in the experimental group showed significantly less decrease in body weight, serum albumin and haemoglobin levels, a lower incidence rates of grade {$\geq$}3 myelosuppression and infection, and a higher completion rate of CCRT than those in the control group. While analyses of the 2 and 3 year overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) did not reveal differences between these groups, we observed a significantly higher OS at 1 year (83.6\% vs. 70.0\%). In the subgroup analysis, patients with patient-generated subjective global assessment (PG-SGA)=C were likely to have better OS and PFS with enteral nutrition. CONCLUSIONS: In EC patients treated with CCRT, enteral nutrition conferred positive effects on the nutritional status, treatment toxicities and prognosis, which mandate its inclusion in clinical practice.

  abstract = {Although guidelines recommend the use of single-unit red blood cell (RBC) transfusions to minimize allogeneic blood exposure, clinical practice remains dominated by two-unit transfusions. This study assesses the potential impact of a single-unit transfusion policy on reducing RBC utilization. We performed a retrospective analysis of adult patients admitted to a tertiary care hospital who received one or two RBC units. In subjects transfused two units, the effect of one unit was estimated by dividing the change in haemoglobin by 2. The proportion of patients reaching a haemoglobin threshold of 70, 75, 80, 85 and 90 g L(-1) with a single RBC unit was estimated. Of 302 included patients, only 65 received a one-unit transfusion. Based on thresholds of {$>$} or = 90, {$>$} or = 80 and {$>$} or = 70 g L(-1), a single-unit transfusion would be sufficient in 42.0\% (RRR = 0.54), 79.6\% (RRR = 0.23) and 98.0\% (RRR = 0.02) of cases, respectively. This corresponds to 0.21, 0.57 and 0.82 mean RBC units saved per patient. In the orthopaedic subpopulation, the mean RBC units saved are 0.53, 0.88 and 1.00 for the same haemoglobin targets. Adopting a policy of transfusing RBC in single-unit aliquots could significantly improve RBC utilization and decrease patient exposure to allogeneic blood.},

We investigated the effect of surgery plus postoperative (adjuvant) chemoradiotherapy on the survival of patients with resectable adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastroesophageal junction. METHODS: A total of 556 patients with resected adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastroesophageal junction were randomly assigned to surgery plus postoperative chemoradiotherapy or surgery alone. The adjuvant treatment consisted of 425 mg of fluorouracil per square meter of body-surface area per day, plus 20 mg of leucovorin per square meter per day, for five days, followed by 4500 cGy of radiation at 180 cGy per day, given five days per week for five weeks, with modified doses of fluorouracil and leucovorin on the first four and the last three days of radiotherapy. One month after the completion of radiotherapy, two five-day cycles of fluorouracil (425 mg per square meter per day) plus leucovorin (20 mg per square meter per day) were given one month apart. RESULTS: The median overall survival in the surgery-only group was 27 months, as compared with 36 months in the chemoradiotherapy group; the hazard ratio for death was 1.35 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.09 to 1.66; P=0.005). The hazard ratio for relapse was 1.52 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.23 to 1.86; P{$<$}0.001). Three patients (1 percent) died from toxic effects of the chemoradiotherapy; grade 3 toxic effects occurred in 41 percent of the patients in the chemoradiotherapy group, and grade 4 toxic effects occurred in 32 percent. CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative chemoradiotherapy should be considered for all patients at high risk for recurrence of adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastroesophageal junction who have undergone curative resection.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Minimal access surgery for gastrointestinal cancer has short-term benefits but is associated with a proficiency-gain curve. The aim of this study was to define national proficiency-gain curves for minimal access colorectal and oesophagogastric surgery, and to determine the impact on clinical outcomes. METHODS: All adult patients undergoing minimal access oesophageal, colonic and rectal surgery between 2002 and 2012 were identified from the Hospital Episode Statistics database. Proficiency-gain curves were created using risk-adjusted cumulative sum analysis. Change points were identified, and bootstrapping was performed with 1000 iterations to identify a confidence level. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality; secondary outcomes were 90-day mortality, reintervention, conversion and length of hospital stay. RESULTS: Some 1696, 15\,008 and 16\,701 minimal access oesophageal, rectal and colonic cancer resections were performed during the study period. The change point in the proficiency-gain curve for 30-day mortality for oesophageal, rectal and colonic surgery was 19 (confidence level 98{$\cdot$}4 per cent), 20 (99{$\cdot$}2 per cent) and three (99{$\cdot$}5 per cent) procedures; the mortality rate fell from 4{$\cdot$}0 to 2{$\cdot$}0 per cent (relative risk reduction (RRR) 0{$\cdot$}50, P\,=\,0{$\cdot$}033), from 2{$\cdot$}1 to 1{$\cdot$}2 per cent (RRR 0{$\cdot$}43, P\,{$<$}\,0{$\cdot$}001) and from 2{$\cdot$}4 to 1{$\cdot$}8 per cent (RRR 0{$\cdot$}25, P\,=\,0{$\cdot$}058) respectively. The change point in the proficiency-gain curve for reintervention in oesophageal, rectal and colonic resection was 19 (98{$\cdot$}1 per cent), 32 (99{$\cdot$}5 per cent) and 26 (99{$\cdot$}2 per cent) procedures respectively. There were also significant proficiency-gain curves for 90-day mortality, conversion and length of stay. CONCLUSION: The introduction of minimal access gastrointestinal cancer surgery has been associated with a proficiency-gain curve for mortality and major morbidity at a national level. Unnecessary patient harm should be avoided by appropriate training and monitoring of new surgical techniques.},

  abstract = {Background Although CT-based body composition (BC) metrics may inform disease risk and outcomes, obtaining these metrics has been too resource intensive for large-scale use. Thus, population-wide distributions of BC remain uncertain. Purpose To demonstrate the validity of fully automated, deep learning BC analysis from abdominal CT examinations, to define demographically adjusted BC reference curves, and to illustrate the advantage of use of these curves compared with standard methods, along with their biologic significance in predicting survival. Materials and Methods After external validation and equivalency testing with manual segmentation, a fully automated deep learning BC analysis pipeline was applied to a cross-sectional population cohort that included any outpatient without a cardiovascular disease or cancer who underwent abdominal CT examination at one of three hospitals in 2012. Demographically adjusted population reference curves were generated for each BC area. The z scores derived from these curves were compared with sex-specific thresholds for sarcopenia by using {$\chi$}2 tests and used to predict 2-year survival in multivariable Cox proportional hazards models that included weight and body mass index (BMI). Results External validation showed excellent correlation (R = 0.99) and equivalency (P {$<$} .001) of the fully automated deep learning BC analysis method with manual segmentation. With use of the fully automated BC data from 12\,128 outpatients (mean age, 52 years; 6936 [57\%] women), age-, race-, and sex-normalized BC reference curves were generated. All BC areas varied significantly with these variables (P {$<$} .001 except for subcutaneous fat area vs age [P = .003]). Sex-specific thresholds for sarcopenia demonstrated that age and race bias were not present if z scores derived from the reference curves were used (P {$<$} .001). Skeletal muscle area z scores were significantly predictive of 2-year survival (P = .04) in combined models that included BMI. Conclusion Fully automated body composition (BC) metrics vary significantly by age, race, and sex. The z scores derived from reference curves for BC parameters better capture the demographic distribution of BC compared with standard methods and can help predict survival. \textcopyright{} RSNA, 2020 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Endoscopic ablation and vagal-sparing esophagectomy offer the potential for reduced morbidity in patients with high-grade dysplasia or early esophageal adenocarcinoma, but neither includes a lymphadenectomy. Although adequate for intramucosal tumors, both are potentially inadequate for patients with submucosal tumor invasion given the high prevalence of nodal metastases with these lesions. Currently there is no test including endoscopic ultrasound that can accurately determine whether a small tumor is confined to the mucosa or has penetrated into the submucosa. The aim of this study was to compare the pathologic depth of invasion by endoscopic mucosal resection with findings and outcome after surgical resection to assess the accuracy and reliability of endoscopic mucosal resection for staging early esophageal adenocarcinoma. METHODS: From 2001 to 2003, 7 patients presented with small, endoscopically visible adenocarcinomas. All underwent endoscopic mucosal resection followed by surgical resection. RESULTS: Analysis of the resected specimens confirmed that the endoscopic mucosal resection had accurately determined the depth of tumor invasion in all patients, and had completely excised the lesion in all but 1 patient (86\%). Lymph node dissection was included as part of the resection in 2 patients with submucosal invasion by endoscopic mucosal resection, and a vagal-sparing esophagectomy was used in the 5 patients with only intramucosal tumors. All patients are alive and disease-free at a median follow-up of 7 months. CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic mucosal resection accurately determines the depth of tumor invasion, and should be used as a staging procedure in patients with early esophageal cancer when therapies that do not include a lymphadenectomy are considered.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationships between sarcopenia and postoperative complications, and the associations between sarcopenia and perioperative functional changes in patients with esophageal cancer following esophagectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants comprised 104 patients who underwent esophagectomy from July 2011 to April 2015. Preoperative sarcopenia was diagnosed by the presence of low muscle mass and low physical functions according to Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia criteria. Low physical function was defined by loss of grip strength and/or slow walking speed. Postoperative pulmonary, cardiac, infectious, and surgical complications were extracted. Perioperative functional changes were calculated (value at postoperative day 30-value before surgery). For statistical analyses, both uni- and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients (27.9\%) were diagnosed with sarcopenia. The incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications was significantly higher in the sarcopenia group (37.9\%) than in the non-sarcopenia group (17.3\%; P=0.04). There was no relationship between sarcopenia and other complications or perioperative functional changes. Multivariate analysis identified sarcopenia (odds ratio (OR), 3.13; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.12-8.93) and high Brinkman index (OR, 3.46; 95\% CI, 1.20-11.77) as independent risk factors for the development of pulmonary complications. CONCLUSION: The assessment of sarcopenia may be useful to predict the postoperative pulmonary complications following esophagectomy. On the other hand, sarcopenia does not predict cardiac, infectious, and surgical complications or perioperative function.},

This study was performed to identify the effect of sarcopenia on 90-day unplanned readmission and overall survival (OS) after esophagectomy. METHODS: Ninety-eight patients with esophageal cancer who underwent esophagectomy were enrolled in this study. Unplanned readmission was defined as any emergent hospitalization within 90~days after discharge. Sarcopenia, defined as low muscle mass plus low muscle strength and/or low physical performance according to the Asian consensus definition, was assessed prior to esophagectomy. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors that contributed to 90-day unplanned readmission. OS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and a Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess the relationship between sarcopenia and OS. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients (31.6\%) were diagnosed with sarcopenia. The 90-day unplanned readmission rate was significantly higher in patients with sarcopenia than those without (42.9\% vs. 16.4\%, respectively; p~=~0.01). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that sarcopenia was an independent predictor of 90-day unplanned readmission [odds ratio 3.71, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.29-11.05; p~=~0.02], and the log-rank test showed that sarcopenia was associated with OS (p~=~0.01). Moreover, sarcopenia was a significant predictor of OS after adjustment for age, sex, and pathological stage (hazard ratio 2.35, 95\% CI 1.21-4.54; p~=~0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Sarcopenia is a risk factor for 90-day unplanned readmission and OS following esophagectomy. Assessment of sarcopenia could help to identify patients at higher risk of a poor prognosis after esophagectomy.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We examined the relationships between computed tomography (CT)-defined skeletal muscle parameters and the systemic inflammatory response (SIR) in patients with operable primary colorectal cancer (CRC). BACKGROUND: Muscle depletion is characterized by a reduced muscle mass (myopenia) and increased infiltration by inter- and intramuscular fat (myosteatosis). It is recognized as a poor prognostic indicator in patients with cancer, but the underlying factors remain unclear. METHODS: A total of 763 patients diagnosed with CRC undergoing elective surgical resection between 2006 and 2013 were included. Image analysis of CT scans was used to calculate Lumbar skeletal muscle index (LSMI), and mean muscle attenuation (MA). The SIR was quantified by the preoperative neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and albumin levels. Correlation and multivariate regression analysis was performed to identify independent relationships between patient SIR and muscle characteristics. RESULTS: Patients with NLR {$>$} 3 had significantly lower LSMI and lower MA than those with NLR {$<$} 3 [LSMI = 42.07{$\mkern1mu$}cmm vs 44.27{$\mkern1mu$}cmm (P = 0.002) and MA = 30.04 Hounsfield unit (HU) vs 28.36 HU (P = 0.016)]. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that high NLR [odds ratio (OR) = 1.78 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.29-2.45), P {$<$} 0.001] and low albumin [OR = 1.80 (95\% CI: 1.17-2.74), P = 0.007] were independent predictors of reduced muscle mass. High NLR was significantly related with a low mean MA and hence myosteatosis [OR = 1.60 (95\% CI: 1.03-2.49), P = 0.038]. CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight a direct association between myopenia, myosteatosis, and the host SIR in patients with operable CRC. A better understanding of factors that regulate muscle changes such as myopenia and myosteatosis may lead to the development of novel therapies that influence a more metabolically "healthy" skeletal muscle and potentially alter cancer outcomes.},

  abstract = {Esophageal cancer, despite its tendency to increase among younger patients, remains a disease of the elderly, with the peak incidence between 70-79 years. In spite of that, elderly patients are still excluded from major clinical trials and they are frequently offered suboptimal treatment even for curable stages of the disease. In this review, a clear survival benefit is demonstrated for elderly patients treated with neoadjuvant treatment, surgery, and even definitive chemoradiation compared to palliative or no treatment. Surgery in elderly patients is often associated with higher morbidity and mortality compared to younger patients and may put older frail patients at increased risk of autonomy loss. Definitive chemoradiation is the predominant modality offered to elderly patients, with very promising results especially for squamous cell cancer, although higher rates of acute toxicity might be encountered. Based on the all the above, and although the best available evidence comes from retrospective studies, it is not justified to refrain from curative treatment for elderly patients based on their age alone. Thorough assessment and an adapted treatment plan as well as inclusion of elderly patients in ongoing clinical trials will allow better understanding and management of esophageal cancer in this heterogeneous and often frail population.},

After stent placement, dysphagia improved in all patients. With regard to complications, one patient developed an esophageal perforation that required urgent esophagectomy. Four patients presented stent migration. Three of these patients required enteral nutrition and none was submitted to surgery because of poor nutritional status. Of the other six patients, only four were operated upon. Stent placement presented a high complication rate and did not prevent weight loss or malnutrition. Other alternatives, including naso-gastric tube placement or endoscopic percutaneous gastrostomy or jejunostomy, should be considered.},

  abstract = {Background Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) has not been widely used in esophageal cancer because of concerns about safety of dilatation, suitability of the stomach as an esophageal replacement, and potential for inoculation metastasis. Methods Experience with PEG in consecutive patients presenting with new esophageal cancer from March 1991 to March 2001 was reviewed retrospectively. PEG was planned in 119 of 179 (66\%) of these patients excluding those presenting moribund and those for whom early resection was planned. The PEG was placed using an endoscopic method with wire-guided endoscopic bougienage or laser ablation or both as needed. Success of placement, requirement for dilatation and ablation, PEG-related complications, tolerance of enteral feeds, and impact on therapy were evaluated. Results PEG placement was possible in 87\% of patients (103 of 119). Dilatation or laser ablation or both was required in 46\% (47 of 103). There was no procedure-related mortality. Thirty-day mortality was 13.5\%. Major PEG-related complications were observed in 4\% (4 of 103) and minor PEG-related complications in 12\% (12 of 103). PEG removal was required in 4 patients and interruption of enteral feeds required in 33 (32\%). No instances of esophageal disruption or tumor inoculation metastasis were noted. PEG takedown and site closure at the time of operation was uncomplicated and use of the stomach as an esophageal substitute was possible in all 61 resected patients. Rates of anastomotic leak, stricture, and gastric emptying delay were similar to those for patients proceeding to resection without prior PEG (leak: PEG = 8\% [5 of 61] versus non-PEG = 10.5\% [2 of 19]), (stricture: PEG = 37\% [22 of 61] versus non-PEG = 32.5\% [6 of 19]), (delay: PEG = 9.8\% [6 of 61] versus non-PEG = 10.5\% [2 of 19]). Analysis of variables showed PEG to be significantly related to attainment of target doses of chemoradiotherapy (p = 0.034), and survival at 12 months (p = 0.02). Conclusions PEG in esophageal cancer is safe and useful and does not compromise the stomach or esophagogastric anastomosis. Further study is required to define the efficacy of PEG as a means of nutritional support and its impact on survival.},

  abstract = {The objective of this systematic review is to identify key components of enhanced recovery protocols (ERP) that lead to improved length of hospital stay (LOS) following esophagectomy. Relevant electronic databases were searched for studies comparing clinical outcome from esophagectomy followed by a conventional pathway versus ERP. Relevant outcome measures were compared and metaregression was performed to identify the key ERP components associated with reduced in LOS. Thirteen publications were included, ERP was associated with no changes in in-hospital mortality, total complications, anastomotic leak, or pulmonary complications compared with a conventional pathway, however LOS was reduced in the ERP group. Metaregression identified that immediate extubation was associated with reduced LOS (OR = -0.51, 95\%CI -0.77 to -0.25; P~{$<~$}0.01). Several postoperative factors were associated with a significant reduction in length of hospital stay, and in order of most important were (i) gastrograffin swallow {$\leq$}5 days (OR = -4.27, 95\%CI -4.50 to -4.03); (ii) mobilization on postoperative day {$\leq$}1 (OR = -2.49, 95\%CI -2.63 to -2.34); (iii) removal of urinary catheter {$\leq$}2 days (OR = -0.99, 95\%CI -1.15 to -0.84); (iv) oral intake with at least sips of fluid {$\leq$}1 day (OR = -0.96, 95\%CI -1.24 to -0.68); (v) enteral diet with feeding jejunostomy or gastrostomy {$\leq~$}1 day (OR = -0.57, 95\%CI -0.80 to -0.35) and (vi) epidural removal {$\leq~$}4 days (OR = -0.17, 95\%CI -0.27 to -0.07). Several core ERP components and principles appear to be associated with LOS reduction. These elements should form a part of the core ERP for the specialty, while surgical teams incorporate other elements through an iterative process.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: We aimed to identify the presence and length of esophagectomy proficiency gain curves in terms of short- and long-term mortality for esophageal cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients who underwent esophagectomy for esophageal cancer between 1987 and 2010 with follow-up until 2014 were identified from a well-established, population-based, nationwide Swedish cohort study. Proficiency gain curves were created by using risk-adjusted cumulative sum analysis for 30-day, 90-day, 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year all-cause and disease-specific mortality measures. Similarly, the proficiency gain curves for lymph node harvest, resection margin status, and reoperation incidence were assessed as performance-contributing factors to the observed changes in long-term survival. RESULTS: Esophagectomies in 1,821 patients with esophageal cancer were conducted by 139 surgeons. The change-point in proficiency gain curve for all-cause 30-day mortality was early, at 15 cases, when mortality decreased from 7.9\% to 3.1\% (P {$<$} .001). Later change-points, which ranged from 35 to 59 cases, were observed for 1-, 3- and 5-year mortality rates, for which all-cause mortality decreased from 34.9\% to 27.7\% (P = .011), from 47.4\% to 41.5\% (P = .049), and from 31.4\% to 19.1\% (P = .009), respectively. Similar change-points were observed in disease-specific mortality at 1 and 3 years. There was a continuous increase in lymph node harvest, which did not plateau. Also, change-points were observed for resection margin with tumor involvement at 17 cases, with a reduction from 20.9\% to 15.2\% (P = .004), and for reoperation rate at 55 cases, with a reduction from 12.6\% to 5.0\% (P {$<$} .001). CONCLUSION: The gain of proficiency in esophagectomy for cancer is associated with measurable changes in short- and long-term mortality results. These findings indicate a need for structured national training and mentorship programs for esophageal cancer surgery.},

METHODS: Data were collected from 30 European centres from 2000 to 2010. Among 2944 included patients, 355 patients (12.1\%) had cT2N0 disease; 285 (S) and 70 (NS), were compared in terms of short- and long-term outcomes. Propensity score matching analyses were used to compensate for differences in baseline characteristics. RESULTS: No significant differences between the groups were shown in terms of in hospital morbidity and mortality. Nodal disease was observed in 50\% of S-group at the time of surgery, with 20\% pN2/N3. Utilisation of neoadjuvant therapy was associated with significant tumour downstaging as reflected by increases in pT0, pN0 and pTNM stage 0 disease, this effect was further enhanced with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. After adjustment on propensity score and confounding factors, for all patients and subset analysis of squamous cell and adenocarcinoma, neoadjuvant therapy had no significant effect upon survival or recurrence (overall, loco-regional, distant or mixed) compared to surgery alone. There were no significant differences between neoadjuvant chemotherapy and chemoradiotherapy in short- or long-term outcomes. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that a surgery alone treatment approach should be recommended as the primary treatment approach for cT2N0 oesophageal cancer despite 50\% of patients having nodal disease at the time of surgery.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Combined chemoradiotherapy is increasingly being used as definitive treatment for locoregional esophageal malignancy. Patients with residual or recurrent localized cancer are often selectively considered for salvage esophagectomy (SALV). The aim of this pooled analysis was to compare short-term clinical outcomes from SALV following definitive chemoradiotherapy with those from planned esophagectomy following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NCRS). METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, trial registries, conference proceedings and reference lists were searched for relevant comparative studies. Primary outcome measures were in-hospital mortality, anastomotic leak and pulmonary complications. Secondary outcomes were length of hospital stay, negative (R0) resection margin, and estimated blood loss. RESULTS: Eight studies comprising 954 patients; 242 (SALV) and 712 (NCRS) were included. SALV was associated with a significantly increased incidence of post-operative mortality (9.50 vs. 4.07 \%; pooled odds ratio [POR] = 3.02; p {$<$} 0.001), anastomotic leak (23.97 vs. 14.47 \%; POR = 1.99; p = 0.005), pulmonary complications (29.75 vs. 16.99 \%; POR = 2.12; p {$<$} 0.001), and an increased length of hospital stay (weighted mean difference = 8.29 days; 95 \% CI 7.08-9.5; p {$<$} 0.001). There were no significant differences between the groups in the incidence of negative resection margins or estimated blood loss. CONCLUSIONS: SALV has poorer short-term outcomes when compared with planned esophagectomy following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Patients and multidisciplinary tumor boards should be made aware of these differences in outcomes and SALV should be reserved for practice in high-volume institutions.},

METHODS: A nationwide cohort study was conducted in Sweden in 2001-2004, with follow-up to 2008. Weight was assessed before oesophagectomy, after 6 months and at 3 years. Logistic regression was performed with adjustment for confounders. Odds ratios (ORs) for postoperative weight loss of at least 15 per cent were estimated. RESULTS: Some 203 patients survived at least 3 years after oesophagectomy. Continuous weight loss occurred for up to 3 years. Women and men had a similar risk of malnutrition after 3 years (OR 0.85 (95 per cent confidence interval 0.24 to 2.98)). In overweight patients (preoperative body mass index at least 25 kg/m(2)) the risk of malnutrition was increased almost fivefold at 6 months (OR 4.90 (2.27 to 10.59)) and 3 years (OR 4.60 (1.80 to 11.78)). There was no difference in weight loss at 6 months between survivors and those who died between 6 months and 3 years after surgery (OR 1.11 (0.64 to 1.94)). CONCLUSION: Weight loss can be long lasting after oesophagectomy; overweight patients are at particularly increased risk of malnutrition.},

The aim of this population-based study was to identify such risk factors. METHODS: Data were collected from a nationwide Swedish organization for research on surgery for oesophageal cancer. A total of 340 patients (75.9 per cent of those eligible) responded to a study-specific questionnaire concerning height and weight, just before and 6 months after surgery. Factors influencing malnutrition, defined as loss of body mass index of at least 15 per cent 6 months after operation, were identified by logistic regression. RESULTS: Neoadjuvant therapy (received by 10.6 per cent of all patients) and female sex were associated with at least a twofold increased risk of weight loss (odds ratio (OR) 2.41 (95 per cent confidence interval 1.01 to 5.77) and 2.14 (1.07 to 4.28) respectively), whereas preoperative weight loss was associated with a decreased risk (OR 0.13 (0.03 to 0.65)). Age, tumour stage and location, type of oesophageal substitute, suture technique and postoperative complications did not influence the risk.

The aim of this study was to estimate weight change after surgery in a population-based setting and to identify nutritional problems that might correlate with weight loss. METHODS: Data were collected through the Swedish Esophageal and Cardia Cancer Register, a nationwide registry of oesophageal cancer surgery. Patients who underwent oesophageal cancer surgery between 2001 and 2004 were followed up until April 2005, and data on patient and tumour characteristics and surgical treatment were collected. Six months after surgery the patients were asked to complete a questionnaire about weight and a health-related quality of life questionnaire (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC QLQ-C30) with an oesophageal-specific module (EORTC QLQ-OES18)). RESULTS: The response rate to the questionnaire was 76.9 per cent and weight change in 226 patients was analysed. Six months after operation 63.7 per cent had lost more than 10 per cent of their preoperative BMI, and 20.4 per cent had lost more than 20 per cent. Appetite loss, eating difficulties and odynophagia were significantly linked to postoperative weight loss, whereas dysphagia or reflux did not correlate with malnutrition. CONCLUSION: Malnutrition is a considerable problem after oesophagectomy, and is linked to appetite loss, eating difficulties and odynophagia.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Emerging evidence suggests muscle depletion predicts survival of patients with cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: At a cancer center in Alberta, Canada, consecutive patients with cancer (lung or GI; N = 1,473) were assessed at presentation for weight loss history, lumbar skeletal muscle index, and mean muscle attenuation (Hounsfield units) by computed tomography (CT). Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted. Concordance (c) statistics were used to test predictive accuracy of survival models. RESULTS: Body mass index (BMI) distribution was 17\% obese, 35\% overweight, 36\% normal weight, and 12\% underweight. Patients in all BMI categories varied widely in weight loss, muscle index, and muscle attenuation. Thresholds defining associations between these three variables and survival were determined using optimal stratification. High weight loss, low muscle index, and low muscle attenuation were independently prognostic of survival. A survival model containing conventional covariates (cancer diagnosis, stage, age, performance status) gave a c statistic of 0.73 (95\% CI, 0.67 to 0.79), whereas a model ignoring conventional variables and including only BMI, weight loss, muscle index, and muscle attenuation gave a c statistic of 0.92 (95\% CI, 0.88 to 0.95; P {$<$} .001). Patients who possessed all three of these poor prognostic variables survived 8.4 months (95\% CI, 6.5 to 10.3), regardless of whether they presented as obese, overweight, normal weight, or underweight, in contrast to patients who had none of these features, who survived 28.4 months (95\% CI, 24.2 to 32.6; P {$<$} .001). CONCLUSION: CT images reveal otherwise occult muscle depletion. Patients with cancer who are cachexic by the conventional criterion (involuntary weight loss) and by two additional criteria (muscle depletion and low muscle attenuation) share a poor prognosis, regardless of overall body weight.},

We investigated the prevalence of computed tomography (CT)-defined sarcopenia and myosteatosis across different levels of nutrition risk assessed by the Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment Short Form (PG-SGA SF). We also evaluated whether the PG-SGA SF, sarcopenia, and myosteatosis were prognostic of overall survival. METHODS: This was a prospective, observational study. Consecutive patients with body mass index {$\geq$}25.0 kg/m2 with newly diagnosed head and neck cancer (any stage) or lung and gastrointestinal tract cancer (locally recurrent or metastatic) were screened at presentation to oncology clinics. Nutrition risk was assigned based on PG-SGA SF triage recommendations. Based on CT, patients were classified with sarcopenia and/or myosteatosis using published cutoffs. Survival analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Patients (n=1157) were 63.6 {$\pm$} 11.4 years, 64\% male, and 61\% had stage IV disease. Sarcopenia and myosteatosis were prevalent across PG-SGA SF nutrition risk categories (scores 0-1 [no risk; 36\% sarcopenic; 44\% myosteatotic], scores 2-3 [37\%; 37\%], scores 4-8 [40\%; 41\%], and scores {$\geq$}9 [high risk; 50\%; 49\%]). In multivariable survival analysis, PG-SGA SF scores {$\geq$}9 (hazard ratio [HR] 2.08, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.66-2.60, P{$<$}0.001), sarcopenia (HR 1.25, 95\% CI 1.06-1.46, P=0.006), and myosteatosis (HR 1.25, 95\% CI 1.07-1.46, P{$<$}0.001) independently predicted reduced survival.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia, visceral obesity (VO), and reduced muscle radiodensity (myosteatosis) are suggested risk factors for postoperative morbidity in colorectal cancer (CRC), but usually are not concurrently assessed. Published thresholds used to define these features are not CRC-specific and are defined in relation to mortality, not postoperative outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate body composition in relation to length of hospital stay (LOS) and postoperative outcomes. METHODS: Pre-surgical computed tomography (CT) images were assessed for total area and radiodensity of skeletal muscle and visceral adipose tissue in a pooled Canadian and UK cohort (n\,=\,2100). Sex- and age-specific values for these features were calculated. For 1139 of 2100 patients, LOS data were available, and sex- and age-specific thresholds for sarcopenia, myosteatosis, and VO were defined on the basis of LOS. Association of CT-defined features with LOS and readmissions was explored using negative binomial and logistic regression models, respectively. RESULTS: In the multivariable analysis, the predictors of LOS (P\,{$<$}\,0.001) were age, surgical approach, major complications (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 2.42; 95\% confidence interval [CI] 2.18-2.68), study cohort, and three body composition profiles characterized by myosteatosis combined with either sarcopenia (IRR, 1.27; 95\% CI 1.12-1.43) or VO (IRR, 1.25; 95\% CI 1.10-1.42), and myosteatosis combined with both sarcopenia and VO (IRR, 1.58; 95\% CI 1.29-1.93). In the multivariable analysis, risk of readmission was associated with VO alone (odds ratio [OR] 2.66; 95\% CI 1.18-6.00); P\,=\,0.018), VO combined with myosteatosis (OR, 2.72; 95\% CI 1.36-5.46; P\,=\,0.005), or VO combined with myosteatosis and sarcopenia (OR, 2.98; 95\% CI 1.06-5.46; P\,=\,0.038). Importantly, the effect of body composition profiles on LOS and readmission was independent of major complications. CONCLUSION: The findings showed that CT-defined multidimensional body habitus is independently associated with LOS and hospital readmission.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective nested cohort of patients with metastatic cancer were accrued from different units of a Regional Palliative Care Program. Patients completed a nutritional screen on admission. Data included age, sex, cancer site, height, weight history, dietary intake, 13 nutrition impact symptoms, and patient- and physician-reported performance status (PS). Univariate and multivariate survival analyses were conducted. Concordance statistics (c-statistics) were used to test the predictive accuracy of models based on training and validation sets; a c-statistic of 0.5 indicates the model predicts the outcome as well as chance; perfect prediction has a c-statistic of 1.0. RESULTS: A training set of patients in palliative home care (n = 1,164) was used to identify prognostic variables. Primary disease site, PS, short-term weight change (either gain or loss), dietary intake, and dysphagia predicted survival in multivariate analysis (P {$<$} .05). A model including only patients separated by disease site and PS with high c-statistics between predicted and observed responses for survival in the training set (0.90) and validation set (0.88; n = 603). The addition of weight change, dietary intake, and dysphagia did not further improve the c-statistic of the model. The c-statistic was also not altered by substituting physician-rated palliative PS for patient-reported PS. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate a high probability of concordance between predicted and observed survival for patients in distinct palliative care settings (home care, tertiary inpatient, ambulatory outpatient) based on patient-reported information.},

METHODS: A population-based study was conducted in Sweden between 2001 and 2005, with regular follow-up for 5~years. Current weight, weight at operation, and average weight were assessed and dichotomized as weight loss of {$\geq$}15~\%. Logistic regression estimated relative risks of weight loss between pre- and 5~years postoperatively, expressed as odds ratios (ORs) with 95~\% confidence intervals (CIs). Statistically significant differences in nutritional symptoms between weight loss groups were analyzed using linear regression models to likewise test as risk factors. Body mass index (BMI) at operation ({$<$} or {$\geq$}25), sex, and preoperative weight loss ({$<$} or {$\geq$}10~\%) were tested as risk factors. Nutritional symptoms were selected from the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 and QLQ-OES18, including fatigue, nausea and vomiting, dyspnoea, appetite loss, diarrhea, and dysphagia, eating difficulties, reflux and pain. RESULTS: A total of 117 patients were included. Patients with preoperative BMI {$\geq$}25 were at a threefold increased risk (OR 3.2; 95~\% CI 1.4-7.3) for postoperative weight loss of {$\geq$}15~\% 5~years after operation. Moreover, eating difficulties, pain, fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and appetite loss were clinically relevant and statistically significantly worse symptoms experienced among those with a weight loss of {$\geq$}15~\% (all at p~{$<~$}0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Overweight at the time of operation is associated with postoperative weight loss from a long-term perspective. Several nutritional symptoms are associated with weight loss of {$>$}15~\% 5~years postoperatively.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Existing definitions of clinically important weight loss (WL) in patients with cancer are unclear and heterogeneous and do not consider current trends toward obesity. METHODS: Canadian and European patients with cancer (n = 8,160) formed a population-based data set. Body mass index (BMI) and percent WL (\%WL) were recorded, and patients were observed prospectively until death. Data were entered into a multivariable analysis controlling for age, sex, cancer site, stage, and performance status. Relationships for BMI and \%WL to overall survival were examined to develop a grading system. RESULTS: Mean overall \%WL was -9.7\% {$\pm$} 8.4\% and BMI was 24.4 {$\pm$} 5.1 kg/m(2), and both \%WL and BMI independently predicted survival (P {$<$} .01). Differences in survival were observed across five categories of BMI ({$<$} 20.0, 20.0 to 21.9, 22.0 to 24.9, 25.0 to 27.9, and {$\geq$} 28.0 kg/m(2); P {$<$} .001) and five categories of \%WL (-2.5\% to -5.9\%, -6.0\% to -10.9\%, -11.0\% to -14.9\%, {$\geq$} -15.0\%, and weight stable ({$\pm$} 2.4\%); P {$<$} .001). A 5 \texttimes{} 5 matrix representing the five \%WL categories within each of the five BMI categories was graded based on median survival and prognostic significance. Weight-stable patients with BMI {$\geq$} 25.0 kg/m(2) (grade 0) had the longest survival (20.9 months; 95\% CI, 17.9 to 23.9 months), and \%WL values associated with lowered categories of BMI were related to shorter survival (P {$<$} .001), as follows: grade 1, 14.6 months (95\% CI, 12.9 to 16.2 months); grade 2, 10.8 months (95\% CI, 9.7 to 11.9 months); grade 3, 7.6 months (95\% CI, 7.0 to 8.2 months); and grade 4, 4.3 months (95\% CI, 4.1 to 4.6 months). Survival discrimination by grade was observed within specific cancers, stages, ages, and performance status and in an independent validation sample (n = 2,963).

This study aimed to clarify the relationship between early postoperative skeletal muscle change and cancer prognosis, and propose effective interventions to prevent sarcopenia. METHODS: This study retrospectively analyzed 152 patients who underwent esophagectomy for esophageal cancer. Total psoas muscle area (TPA) was measured before surgery as baseline and on postoperative day 7 ({$\pm~$}2). The effect of early postoperative skeletal muscle loss on 5-year survival was investigated. Moreover, 5-year survival in patients with postoperative complications and a high inflammatory status, which were previously reported as poor prognostic factors of esophageal cancer, was also investigated. RESULTS: Among the 152 patients, 52 (34.2\%) showed a decrease in TPA, while 100 (65.8\%) maintained their TPA. The TPA decreasing group exhibited poor 5-year overall survival (OS) (p~=~0.003) and 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) (p~{$<~$}0.001). The TPA decreasing group also showed a poor 5-year OS in patients who developed severe postoperative complications (p~=~0.015). Multivariate analyses showed that decreased TPA was found to be independently associated with OS (p~=~0.017) as well as RFS (p~=~0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested a relationship between decreased TPA within 1~week after esophagectomy and long-term prognosis among patients with esophageal cancer. If TPA can be maintained, the prognosis was better even in cases with serious complications.},

However, it has not been clarified whether skeletal muscle change during neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery adversely affects prognosis. This study aimed to determine the relation between skeletal muscle change and survival for patients with advanced esophageal cancer who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery. METHODS: This study retrospectively analyzed 66 patients with thoracic esophageal cancer who had undergone neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by esophagectomy. The study investigated the correlation between the change in the total muscle cross-sectional area at the third lumbar vertebra before and 4~months after surgery as well as the postoperative recurrence and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Of the 66 patients, 39 (59\%) showed a skeletal muscle decrease from baseline to 4~months after esophagectomy. The change in the skeletal muscle index from baseline to 4~months after surgery was -1.2~cm2/m2. Multivariable analysis showed that nonsquamous cell carcinoma subtype (hazard ratio [HR] 2.57; p~=~0.029), pathologic stage (HR 5.73; p~{$<~$}0.01), and skeletal muscle wasting (HR per 1 unit decrease in skeletal muscle index, 1.16; p~=~0.015) were the independent prognostic factors associated with worse OS. Additionally, pathologic stage (HR 6.03; p~{$<~$}0.01) and skeletal muscle wasting (HR per 1 unit decrease in skeletal muscle index, 1.11; p~=~0.048) also were found to be independent prognostic factors associated with worse recurrence-free survival.

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Single-center studies identify frailty as a risk factor for 30-day postoperative mortality. The long-term and population-level effect of frailty on postoperative mortality is, to our knowledge, poorly described, as are the interactions of frailty with important predictors of mortality. OBJECTIVE: To measure the population-level effect of patient frailty on, and its association with, 1-year postoperative mortality. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Population-based retrospective cohort study in Ontario, Canada, with data collected between April 1, 2002 and March 31, 2012. Analysis was performed from December 2014 to March 2015. All patients were community-dwelling individuals aged 65 years or older on the day of elective, major noncardiac surgery. EXPOSURE: Frailty, as defined by the Johns Hopkins Adjusted Clinical Groups (ACG) frailty-defining diagnoses indicator. The ACG frailty-defining diagnoses indicator is a binary variable that uses 12 clusters of frailty-defining diagnoses. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: One-year all-cause postoperative mortality. RESULTS: Of 202 811 patients, 6289 (3.1\%) were frail (mean [SD] age, 77 [7] years). Within 1 year, 13.6\% (n\,=\,855) of frail and 4.8\% (n\,=\,9433) of nonfrail patients died. Adjustment for sociodemographic and surgical confounders resulted in a hazard ratio of 2.23 (95\% CI, 2.08-2.40). The interaction between frailty and postoperative time demonstrated an increased relative hazard for death in frail patients (hazard ratio, 35.58; 95\% CI, 29.78-40.19) on postoperative day 3. The association between frailty and increased risk of death decreased with patient age (HR, 2.66; 95\% CI, 2.28-3.10 at age 65; HR, 1.63; 95\% CI, 1.36-1.95 at age 90). Significant variations in the increased risk for death in frail patients existed between different surgery types and was strongest after total joint arthroplasty (HR, 3.79; 95\% CI, 3.21-4.47 for hip replacement; HR, 2.68; 95\% CI, 2.10-3.42 for knee replacement). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: At a population level, preoperative frailty-defining diagnoses were associated with a significantly increased risk of 1-year mortality that was particularly notable in the early postoperative period, in younger patients, and after joint arthroplasty.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The influence of preoperative hemoglobin levels on outcomes of patients undergoing esophagectomy for cancer is not clearly defined. The goal of this article was to explore the association between combined modality therapy, preoperative anemia status, and perioperative blood transfusion and risk of postoperative complications among patients undergoing esophageal resection. METHODS: From a retrospective esophageal database, 413 patients were identified. Anemia was defined according to the World Health Organization classification of {$<$}13 g/dL or {$<$}12 g/dL for men or women, respectively. Statistical analysis was performed with analysis of variance, Pearson's chi(2), or Fisher exact test as appropriate. The independent association of anemia, blood transfusion, and combined modality treatment on risk of postoperative complications were examined using multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: Information on combined modality treatment, preoperative hemoglobin levels, and blood transfusion was available for 413 patients, of whom 57\% received combined modality treatment. Overall 197 (47.6\%) patients were preoperatively found to be anemic, and those who had received combined modality treatment were more likely to be anemic (60.6\% versus 30.7\%, P {$<$} 0.001). Anemic patients required more blood transfusions than nonanemic patients (46.7\% versus 29.6\%, P {$<$} 0.001). Seventy-five percent of patients who required transfusion during the hospital stay had received combined modality treatment (P = 0.01). Combined modality treatment and anemia were not associated with increased risk of complications. Patients with any perioperative complication and surgical site infections were more likely to have received blood transfusion compared to patients without complications (OR = 1.73; 95\% CI 1.04-2.87 and OR = 2.98; 95\% CI 1.04-8.55; respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we determined that administration of neoadjuvant treatment to esophageal cancer patients was not associated with an increased rate of perioperative complications. Preoperative anemia did not predict worsened short-term outcomes, but increased the chances of red blood cell transfusion, which were significantly associated with higher overall complications and increased risk of surgical site infections. These data confirm previous studies that allogenic red blood cell transfusions are independent risk factors for increased morbidity and mortality and should be minimized during surgery for esophageal cancer.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the accuracy of preoperative staging of rectal cancer with magnetic resonance imaging to predict surgical circumferential resection margins. DESIGN: Prospective observational study of rectal cancers treated by colorectal multidisciplinary teams between January 2002 and October 2003. SETTING: 11 colorectal units in four European countries. PARTICIPANTS: 408 consecutive patients presenting with all stages of rectal cancer and undergoing magnetic resonance imaging before total mesorectal excision surgery and histopathological assessment of the surgical specimen. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging in predicting a curative resection based on the histological yardstick of presence or absence of tumour at the margins of the specimen. RESULTS: 354 of the 408 patients had a clear circumferential resection margin (87\%, 95\% confidence interval 83\% to 90\%). Specificity for prediction of a clear margin by magnetic resonance imaging was 92\% (327/354, 90\% to 95\%). High resolution scans were technically satisfactory in 93\% (379/408). Surgical specimens were histopathologically graded as complete or moderate in 80\% (328/408), and the median lymph node harvest was 12 (range 0-49). Magnetic resonance imaging predicted clear margins in 349 patients. At surgery 327 had clear margins (94\%, 91\% to 96\%). CONCLUSION: High resolution magnetic resonance imaging accurately predicts whether the surgical resection margins will be clear or affected by tumour. This technique can be reproduced accurately in multiple centres to predict curative resection and warns the multidisciplinary team of potential failure of surgery, thus enabling selection of patients for preoperative treatment.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Often curative treatment for locally advanced resectable esophageal or gastro-esophageal junctional cancer consists of concurrent neoadjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy followed by surgery. Currently, one of the most commonly used chemotherapy regimens in this setting is a combination of a fluoropyrimidin and of a platinum analogue. Due to the promising results of the recent CROSS trial, another regimen combining paclitaxel and carboplatin is also widely used by European and American centers. No clinical study has shown the superiority of one treatment over the other. The objective of this Phase II study is to clarify clinical practice by comparing these two chemotherapy treatments. Our aim is to evaluate, in operable esophageal and gastro-esophageal junctional cancer, the complete resection rate and severe postoperative morbidity rate associated with these two neoadjuvant chemotherapeutic regimens (carboplatin-paclitaxel or fluorouracil-oxaliplatin-folinic acid) when each is combined with the radiation regime utilized in the CROSS trial. METHODS/DESIGN: PROTECT is a prospective, randomized, multicenter, open arms, phase II trial. Eligible patients will have a histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma and be treated with neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy followed by surgery for stage IIB or stage III resectable esophageal cancer. A total of 106 patients will be randomized to receive either 3~cycles of FOLFOX combined to concurrent radiotherapy (41.4 Grays) or carboplatin and paclitaxel with the same radiation regimen, using a 1:1 allocation ratio. DISCUSSION: This ongoing trial offers the unique opportunity to compare two standards of chemotherapy delivered with a common regimen of preoperative radiation, in the setting of operable locally advanced esophageal or gastro-esophageal junctional tumors.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) are commonly used to treat chemotherapy-induced anemia (CIA). However, about half of patients do not benefit. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the benefits and harms related to the use of iron as a supplement to ESA and iron alone compared with ESA alone in the management of CIA. SEARCH METHODS: We searched for relevant trials from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (issue 1 January 2016), MEDLINE (1950 to February 2016), and www.clinicaltrials.gov without using any language limits. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing 'iron plus ESA' or 'iron alone' versus 'ESA alone' in people with CIA were eligible for inclusion. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. MAIN RESULTS: We included eight RCTs (12 comparisons) comparing ESA plus iron versus ESA alone enrolling 2087 participants. We did not find any trial comparing iron alone versus ESAs alone in people with CIA. None of the included RCTs reported overall survival. There was a beneficial effect of iron supplementation to ESAs compared with ESAs alone on hematopoietic response (risk ratio (RR) 1.17, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.09 to 1.26; P {$<$} 0.0001; 1712 participants; 11 comparisons; high-quality evidence). Assuming a baseline risk of 35\% to 80\% for hematopoietic response without iron supplementation, between seven and 16 patients should be treated to achieve hematopoietic response in one patient. In subgroup analyses, RCTs that used intravenous (IV) iron favored ESAs and iron (RR 1.20 (95\% CI 1.10 to 1.31); P {$<$} 0.00001; 1321 participants; eight comparisons), whereas we found no evidence for a difference in hematopoietic response in RCTs using oral iron (RR 1.04 (95\% CI 0.87 to 1.24); P = 0.68; 391 participants; three comparisons). There was no evidence for a difference between the subgroups of IV and oral iron (P = 0.16). There was no evidence for a difference between the subgroups of types of iron (P = 0.31) and types of ESAs (P = 0.16) for hematopoietic response.The iron supplementation to ESAs might be beneficial as fewer participants treated with iron supplementation required red blood cell (RBC) transfusions compared to the number of participants treated with ESAs alone (RR 0.74 (95\% CI 0.60 to 0.92); P = 0.007; 1719 participants; 11 comparisons; moderate-quality evidence). Assuming a baseline risk of 7\% to 40\% for RBC transfusion without iron supplementation, between 10 and 57 patients should be treated to avoid RBC transfusion in one patient.We found no evidence for a difference in the median time to hematopoietic response with addition of iron to ESAs (hazard ratio (HR) 0.93 (95\% CI 0.67 to 1.28); P = 0.65; 1042 participants; seven comparisons; low-quality evidence). In subgroup analyses, RCTs in which dextran (HR 0.95 (95\% CI 0.36 to 2.52); P = 0.92; 340 participants; three comparisons), sucrose iron (HR 1.15 (95\% CI 0.60 to 2.21); P = 0.67; 102 participants; one comparison) and sulfate iron (HR 1.24 (95\% CI 0.99 to 1.56); P = 0.06; 55 participants; one comparison) were used showed no evidence for difference between iron supplementation versus ESAs alone compared with RCTs in which gluconate (HR 0.78 (95\% CI 0.65 to 0.94); P = 0.01; 464 participants; two comparisons) was used for median time to hematopoietic response (P = 0.02). There was no evidence for a difference between the subgroups of route of iron administration (P = 0.13) and types of ESAs (P = 0.46) for median time to hematopoietic response.Our results indicated that there could be improvement in the hemoglobin (Hb) levels with addition of iron to ESAs (mean difference (MD) 0.48 (95\% CI 0.10 to 0.86); P = 0.01; 827 participants; seven comparisons; low-quality evidence). In RCTs in which IV iron was used there was evidence for a difference (MD 0.84 (95\% CI 0.21 to 1.46); P = 0.009; 436 participants; four comparisons) compared with oral iron (MD 0.07 (95\% CI -0.19 to 0.34); P = 0.59; 391 participants; three comparisons) for mean change in Hb level (P = 0.03). RCTs in which dextran (MD 1.55 (95\% CI 0.62 to 2.47); P = 0.001; 102 participants; two comparisons) was used showed evidence for a difference with iron supplementation versus ESAs alone compared with RCTs in which gluconate (MD 0.54 (95\% CI -0.15 to 1.22); P = 0.12; 334 participants; two comparisons) and sulfate iron (MD 0.07 (95\% CI -0.19 to 0.34); P = 0.59; 391 participants; three comparisons) were used for mean change in Hb level (P = 0.007). RCTs in which epoetin was used showed evidence for a difference with iron supplementation versus ESAs alone (MD 0.77 (95\% CI 0.25 to 1.29); P = 0.004; 337 participants; five comparisons) compared with darbepoetin use (MD 0.10 (95\% CI -0.13 to 0.33); P = 0.38; 490 participants; two comparisons) for mean change in Hb level (P = 0.02).We found no evidence for a difference in quality of life with addition of iron to ESAs (standardized mean difference 0.01 (95\% CI -0.10 to 0.12); P = 0.88; 1124 participants; three RCTs; high-quality evidence).We found no evidence for a difference in risk of grade III-IV thromboembolic events (RR 0.95 (95\% CI 0.54 to 1.65); P = 0.85; 783 participants; three RCTs; moderate-quality evidence). The incidence of treatment-related mortality (TRM) was 0\% (997 participants; four comparisons; high-quality evidence).Other common adverse events included vomiting, asthenia, and leukopenia, and were similar in both arms.Overall the risk of bias across outcomes was high to low. Since the included RCTs had shorter follow-up duration (up to 20 weeks), the long-term effects of iron supplementation are unknown. Our main reasons for downgrading the quality of evidence were inconsistency across the included studies and imprecision of results. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Our systematic review shows that addition of iron to ESAs offers superior hematopoietic response, reduces the risk of RBC transfusions, and improves Hb levels, and appears to be well tolerated. None of the included RCTs reported overall survival. We found no evidence for a difference in quality of life with iron supplementation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Esophagectomy induces a systemic inflammatory response whose extent has been recognized as a predictive factor of postoperative respiratory morbidity. The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a protective ventilatory strategy to reduce systemic inflammation in patients undergoing esophagectomy. METHODS: The authors prospectively investigated 52 patients undergoing planned esophagectomy for cancer. Patients were randomly assigned to a conventional ventilation strategy (n = 26; tidal volume of 9 ml/kg during two-lung and one-lung ventilation; no positive end-expiratory pressure) or a protective ventilation strategy (n = 26; tidal volume of 9 ml/kg during two-lung ventilation, reduced to 5 ml/kg during one-lung ventilation; positive end-expiratory pressure 5 cm H2O throughout the operative time). RESULTS: Plasmatic levels of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor alpha were measured perioperatively and postoperatively. Pulmonary function and postoperative evolution were also evaluated. Patients who received protective strategy had lower blood levels of IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-8 at the end of one-lung ventilation (0.24 [0.15-0.40] vs. 0.56 [0.38-0.89] pg/ml, P {$<$} 0.001; 91 [61-117] vs. 189 [127-294] pg/ml, P {$<$} 0.001; and 30 [22-45] vs. 49 [29-69] pg/ml, P {$<$} 0.05, respectively) and 18 h postoperatively (0.18 [0.13-0.30] vs. 0.43 [0.34-0.54] pg/ml, P {$<$} 0.001; 54 [36-89] vs. 116 [78-208] pg/ml, P {$<$} 0.001; 16 [11-24] vs. 35 [28-53] pg/ml, P {$<$} 0.001, respectively). Protective strategy resulted in higher oxygen partial pressure to inspired oxygen fraction ratio during one-lung ventilation and 1 h postoperatively and in a reduction of postoperative mechanical ventilation duration (115 +/- 38 vs. 171 +/- 57 min, P {$<$} 0.001). CONCLUSION: A protective ventilatory strategy decreases the proinflammatory systemic response after esophagectomy, improves lung function, and results in earlier extubation.},

Emptying of the esophageal substitute was assessed by scintigraphy using a 99Tc-labeled solid test meal. The data were compared with measurements performed in 14 controls, in 7 of whom gastric emptying was measured. The gastric emptying half time was 6.8 +/- 6.2 min (median 144 s) in ER cases, significantly shorter than in controls: 70 +/- 29 min (median 51 min). The early integrated (first 30 min) and total integrated insulin and GLP-1 concentrations were significantly higher than in controls. In 3 of 10 esophagectomy patients the blood glucose concentration fell below 3.8 mmol/l postprandially. High GLP-1 concentrations in the first 30 min were associated with low serum glucose during the 2nd h postprandially when all the hypoglycemic episodes occurred. It is concluded that rapid emptying of the esophageal substitute induces the exaggerated GLP-1 response, which is a main factor for reactive hypoglycemia.},

There are limited data concerning the prognostic effect of cachexia on second-line chemotherapy (L2). We aimed to assess the impact of cachexia progression during first-line therapy (L1) on survival after L2. Methods We reviewed patients with gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel (GEM/nabPTX)-refractory APC who underwent L2 with modified FOLFIRINOX or S-1 between 2015 and 2019 in our institution. We determined clinicopathological data including body composition parameters: subcutaneous fat area (SFA), visceral fat area (VFA), and skeletal muscle index (SMI). Correlations of changes in these parameters, as well as their effect on overall survival after L2 (OS2), were examined. Results Median rates of change in SMI, SFA, and VFA were 0.19\%, -4.17\%, and -18.39\%, respectively, in 59 patients during L1. Although there was moderate correlation in rate of change between SFA and VFA, there was no correlation between SMI and other parameters. We defined loss of SFA, VFA, and SMI as decreases greater than 8.5\%, 34.1\%, and 8.7\%, respectively. Median OS2 of patients with loss in any of these parameters was significantly shorter than in patients without loss (3.83 vs. 8.73 months). Multivariate analysis revealed that loss in any parameters, performance status, and C-reactive protein/albumin ratio were independent negative prognostic factors. Conclusion Loss of adipose tissue or skeletal muscle during L1 had a considerable impact on OS2 in APC refractory to GEM/nabPTX.},

  abstract = {Background Self-expandable metal stent (SEMS) insertion and percutaneous gastrostomy (PG) feeding are commonly used for patients with esophageal cancer and dysphagia. This study aimed to compare outcomes between SEMS insertion and PG feeding for them. Methods We retrospectively analyzed 308 patients with esophageal cancer who underwent fully covered SEMS insertion (stent group) or PG (gastrostomy group) for dysphagia due to tumor. Patients with other causes of dysphagia, such as radiation-induced or postoperative stricture, were excluded from the study. Clinical outcomes were compared between the two groups, including overall survival and need for additional intervention and postprocedural nutritional status. Results At baseline, the stent group (n = 169) had more stage IV patients, less cervical cancers, and received radiotherapy and esophagectomy less often than the gastrostomy group (n = 64). The Kaplan-Meier curves showed higher overall survival in the gastrostomy group than in the stent group. Multivariate analysis revealed that PG was associated with better survival compared with SEMS insertion (hazard ratio 0.541, 95\% confidence interval 0.346\textendash 0.848, p = 0.007). In addition, the gastrostomy group needed additional intervention less often (3.1\% vs. 21.9\%, p {$<$} 0.001) and experienced less decrease in serum albumin levels (-0.15 {$\pm$} 0.56 g/dL vs. -0.39 {$\pm$} 0.58 g/dL, p = 0.011) than the stent group after procedure. Conclusions Our data suggested that, compared with SEMS insertion, PG is associated with better overall survival in patients with esophageal cancer and dysphagia. Stabilized nutritional status by PG may play a role in improving patient survival.},

  abstract = {Importance: Preserving functional capacity is a key element in the care continuum for patients with esophagogastric cancer. Prehabilitation, a preoperative conditioning intervention aiming to optimize physical status, has not been tested in upper gastrointestinal surgery to date. Objective: To investigate whether prehabilitation is effective in improving functional status in patients undergoing esophagogastric cancer resection. Design, Setting, and Participants: A randomized clinical trial (available-case analysis based on completed assessments) was conducted at McGill University Health Centre (Montreal, Quebec, Canada) comparing prehabilitation with a control group. Intervention consisted of preoperative exercise and nutrition optimization. Participants were adults awaiting elective esophagogastric resection for cancer. The study dates were February 13, 2013, to February 10, 2017. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was change in functional capacity, measured with absolute change in 6-minute walk distance (6MWD). Preoperative (end of the prehabilitation period) and postoperative (from 4 to 8 weeks after surgery) data were compared between groups. Results: Sixty-eight patients were randomized, and 51 were included in the primary analysis. The control group were a mean (SD) age, 68.0 (11.6) years and 20 (80\%) men. Patients in the prehabilitation group were a mean (SD) age, 67.3 (7.4) years and 18 (69\%) men. Compared with the control group, the prehabilitation group had improved functional capacity both before surgery (mean [SD] 6MWD change, 36.9 [51.4] vs -22.8 [52.5] m; P\,{$<$}\,.001) and after surgery (mean [SD] 6MWD change, 15.4 [65.6] vs -81.8 [87.0] m; P\,{$<$}\,.001). Conclusions and Relevance: Prehabilitation improves perioperative functional capacity in esophagogastric surgery. Keeping patients from physical and nutritional status decline could have a significant effect on the cancer care continuum. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01666158.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 236 patients with clinical stage T1 to T4, N0/1, M0 squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma selected for a nonsurgical approach, after stratification by weight loss, primary tumor size, and histology, were randomized to receive combined-modality therapy consisting of four monthly cycles of fluorouracil (5-FU) (1,000 mg/m(2)/24 hours for 4 days) and cisplatin (75 mg/m(2) bolus day 1) with concurrent 64.8 Gy versus the same chemotherapy schedule but with concurrent 50.4 Gy. The trial was stopped after an interim analysis. The median follow-up was 16.4 months for all patients and 29.5 months for patients still alive. RESULTS: For the 218 eligible patients, there was no significant difference in median survival (13.0 v 18.1 months), 2-year survival (31\% v 40\%), or local/regional failure and local/regional persistence of disease (56\% v 52\%) between the high-dose and standard-dose arms. Although 11 treatment-related deaths occurred in the high-dose arm compared with two in the standard-dose arm, seven of the 11 deaths occurred in patients who had received 50.4 Gy or less. CONCLUSION: The higher radiation dose did not increase survival or local/regional control. Although there was a higher treatment-related mortality rate in the patients assigned to the high-dose radiation arm, it did not seem to be related to the higher radiation dose. The standard radiation dose for patients treated with concurrent 5-FU and cisplatin chemotherapy is 50.4 Gy.},

Earlier MRI and CT validation studies used data-acquisition techniques and data-analysis procedures now outdated, evaluated anatomic rather than adipose tissue-free skeletal muscle (ATFSM), studied only the relatively large thigh, or found unduly large estimation errors. The aim of the present study was to compare arm and leg ATFSM cross-sectional area estimates (cm2) by using standard MRI and CT acquisition and image-analysis methods with corresponding cadaver estimates. A second objective was to validate MRI and CT measurements of adipose tissue embedded within muscle (interstitial adipose tissue) and surrounding muscle (subcutaneous adipose tissue). ATFSM area (n = 119) by MRI [38.9 +/- 22.3 (SD) cm2], CT (39.7 +/- 22.8 cm2), and cadaver (39.5 +/- 23.0 cm2) were not different (P {$>$} 0.001), and both MRI and CT estimates of ATFSM were highly correlated with corresponding cadaver values [MRI: r = 0.99, SE of estimate (SEE) 3.9 cm2, P {$<$} 0.001; and CT: r = 0.99, SEE = 3.8 cm2, P {$<$} 0.001]. Similarly good results were observed between MRI- and CT-measured vs. cadaver-measured interstitial and subcutaneous adipose tissue. For MRI-ATFSM the intraobserver correlation for duplicate measurements in vivo was 0. 99 [SEE = 8.7 cm2 (2.9\%), P {$<$} 0.001]. These findings strongly support the use of MRI and CT as reference methods for appendicular skeletal muscle, interstitial and subcutaneous adipose tissue measurement in vivo.},

This study evaluated the prognostic significance of skeletal muscle status before and after chemotherapy in patients with unresectable colorectal cancer (CRC). Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of 215 consecutive patients with unresectable CRC who underwent systemic chemotherapy. Skeletal muscle cross-sectional area was measured by computed tomography.

There were no significant differences in progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS) associated with skeletal muscle mass before chemotherapy. However, 22 patients with skeletal muscle loss ({$>$}5\%) after chemotherapy showed significantly shorter PFS and OS compared with those without skeletal muscle loss (PFS, log-rank p = 0.029; OS, log-rank p = 0.009). Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that skeletal muscle loss after chemotherapy (hazard ratio, 2.079; 95\% confidence interval, 1.194\textendash 3.619; p = 0.010) was independently associated with OS.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In ninety-four patients who underwent NAC for esophageal cancer, body composition was assessed before and after NAC. Associations between the incidence of toxicities and change in body composition during NAC were investigated. RESULTS: Forty-four (46.8\%) and 50 (53.2\%) out of 94 patients were defined as having sarcopenia before and after NAC, respectively. There was no significant difference in the incidence of any toxicity pre-treatment between patients with sarcopenia and those without sarcopenia. No significant reduction in skeletal muscle mass or fat mass was observed in the patients during NAC (p=0.501 and p=0.072). However, patients who experienced grade 4 neutropenia or febrile neutropenia during NAC showed a significantly larger decrease in change of skeletal muscle mass compared to patients who did not experience those toxicities (p=0.013 and 0.036, respectively). CONCLUSION: The incidence of serious adverse events such as febrile neutropenia and grade 4 neutropenia is associated with a significant reduction of skeletal muscle mass during NAC. We should make an effort to reduce the incidence of adverse events in order to maintain an appropriate body composition during NAC.},

  abstract = {Purpose To provide guidance regarding the practical assessment and management of vulnerabilities in older patients undergoing chemotherapy. Methods An Expert Panel was convened to develop clinical practice guideline recommendations based on a systematic review of the medical literature. Results A total of 68 studies met eligibility criteria and form the evidentiary basis for the recommendations. Recommendations In patients {$\geq$} 65 years receiving chemotherapy, geriatric assessment (GA) should be used to identify vulnerabilities that are not routinely captured in oncology assessments. Evidence supports, at a minimum, assessment of function, comorbidity, falls, depression, cognition, and nutrition. The Panel recommends instrumental activities of daily living to assess for function, a thorough history or validated tool to assess comorbidity, a single question for falls, the Geriatric Depression Scale to screen for depression, the Mini-Cog or the Blessed Orientation-Memory-Concentration test to screen for cognitive impairment, and an assessment of unintentional weight loss to evaluate nutrition. Either the CARG (Cancer and Aging Research Group) or CRASH (Chemotherapy Risk Assessment Scale for High-Age Patients) tools are recommended to obtain estimates of chemotherapy toxicity risk; the Geriatric-8 or Vulnerable Elders Survey-13 can help to predict mortality. Clinicians should use a validated tool listed at ePrognosis to estimate noncancer-based life expectancy {$\geq$} 4 years. GA results should be applied to develop an integrated and individualized plan that informs cancer management and to identify nononcologic problems amenable to intervention. Collaborating with caregivers is essential to implementing GA-guided interventions. The Panel suggests that clinicians take into account GA results when recommending chemotherapy and that the information be provided to patients and caregivers to guide treatment decision making. Clinicians should implement targeted, GA-guided interventions to manage nononcologic problems. Additional information is available at www.asco.org/supportive-care-guidelines .},

  abstract = {Objectives: This study sought to compare differences in blood transfusion and surgical complication rates before and after the implementation of a restrictive blood transfusion protocol. Methods: On July 1, 2018, our institution implemented a restrictive blood transfusion protocol utilizing a hemoglobin trigger of less than 7~g/dL. Retrospective chart review was completed to review patients undergoing major abdominal surgery by the gynecology and gynecologic oncology services 18~months before, and after initiation of the transfusion protocol. Outcomes included number of patients, units transfused and postoperative complication rates. Complications included reoperation on the day of admission, surgical site infections, wound disruptions, pulmonary, renal, central nervous system, and cardiovascular complications, as well as deep venous thromboses, readmissions, and 30-day mortality. Results: There were 290 people in the pre- and 449 patients in the post-protocol group. A similar number of patients received blood transfusions in both groups (9.3\% versus 10.6\% p~=~0.57). However, significantly fewer units of blood were given post-protocol initiation. For every patient who received a transfusion pre-protocol, 2.66 units were administered compared to 1.2 units after the protocol was initiated (p~=~0.003). All postoperative complications were not significantly different between groups (p~{$>~$}0.05). Individual postoperative complications were combined and analyzed using a clustered approach to detect rates of complications more conservatively. Both the 7-system (5.1\% versus 4.9\%, p~=~0.90) and 8-system (5.5\% versus 4.9\%, p~=~0.72) clustered analyses were not significantly different before and after the initiation of the transfusion protocol. Conclusions: A restrictive transfusion protocol is effective in decreasing the number of units of blood transfused without affecting postoperative complication rates in gynecologic surgery patients.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Although computed tomography (CT) is frequently used to determine body composition, the effects of using different CT protocols is not well known. The aim of this study was to determine whether contrast media phase, radiation dose, and slice thickness in CT affect body composition segmentation. METHODS: Clinically indicated perfusion CTs of the upper abdomen in 20 patients (seven women) between 40 and 87 y of age with high suspicion of hepatocellular carcinoma were analyzed retrospectively. Axial images from the L3 level with varying imaging delay were reconstructed after contrast media injection (18 images per patient), slice thickness (5 images, 2-10 mm), and radiation dose (4 images with one-third to four-thirds of standard dose). Muscle and fat areas were segmented semiautomatically by drawing regions of interests and using established cutoff thresholds. Skeletal muscle index (SMI), steatotic muscle area, and adipose tissue index, as well as muscle attenuation and fat attenuation, were evaluated. RESULTS: Average SMI increased by up to 2.8\% after contrast media injection. Steatotic muscle area decreased by {$\leq$}13.8\%, and adipose tissue index decreased by {$\leq$}6.5\%. Muscle attenuation increased after contrast media injection, whereas fat attenuation decreased (all P {$<$} 0.001). SMI decreased by 1.9\% on average when increasing slice thickness from 2 to 10 mm. Steatotic muscle area increased by {$\leq$}3.3\%, and adipose tissue index increased by {$\leq$}1.5\% (all P {$<$} 0.05). Muscle attenuation did not change significantly with reconstruction thickness. Radiation dose had no effect on estimated area of spinal muscle, fatty spinal muscle, or visceral fat. CONCLUSIONS: Contrast media have a strong effect on the evaluation of body composition, whereas the influence of slice thickness is less pronounced. Radiation dose can be reduced by {$\geq$}66\% without significantly affecting segmentation.},

METHODS: Data were obtained from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program for patients who underwent elective high-risk operative procedures, and a frailty index was used to classify the patients. RESULTS: Our study analyzed 232,352 patients with a mean age of 65~years; the majority of patients were males (54\%) and white (78\%). The most common procedure was colectomy (41\%), followed by lower extremity bypass (25\%), gastrectomy (8\%), endovascular abdominal aneurism repair (7\%), pancreatectomy (7\%), cardiac operation (6\%), nephrectomy (3\%), and pulmonary resection (2\%). A majority of the patients were classified as mildly frail (34\%), followed by nonfrail (29\%), moderately frail (21\%), and severely frail (15\%). On univariate analysis, age, race, procedure, sex, and frailty scores were associated with complications, prolonged duration of stay, and 30-day mortality (P~{$<~$}.0001). On multivariate analysis, frailty was associated with complications, prolonged duration of stay, and 30-day mortality. Increasing frailty disproportionately impacted mortality; colectomy showed the greatest mortality in severely frail patients (9.36\%), followed by esophagectomy (8.2\%), pulmonary resection (6.4\%), pancreatectomy (5.8\%), cardiac procedures (4.4\%), gastrectomy (4.3\%), nephrectomy (3.32\%), endovascular abdominal aneurism repair (2.49\%), and lower extremity bypass (2.41\%; P~=~.0001). A similar association between duration of stay and morbidity with frailty was noted. CONCLUSION: Frailty has a significant impact on postoperative outcomes that varies with type of procedure.},

Our objective was to evaluate clinically accessible methods to achieve practical and precise measures of body composition in cancer patients. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)-based analysis of fat and fat-free mass was performed in 50 cancer patients and compared with bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and with regional computed tomography (CT) images available in the patients' medical records. BIA overestimated or underestimated fat-free mass substantially compared with DXA as the method of reference (up to 9.3 kg difference). Significant changes in fat-free mass over time detected with DXA in a subset of 21 patients (+2.2 +/- 3.2\%/100 days, p = 0.003), was beyond the limits of detection of BIA. Regional analysis of fat and fat-free tissue at the 3rd lumbar vertebra with either DXA or CT strongly predicted whole-body fat and fat-free mass (r = 0.86-0.94; p {$<$} 0.001). CT images provided detail on specific muscles, adipose tissues and organs, not provided by DXA or BIA. CT presents great practical significance due to the prevalence of these images in patient diagnosis and follow-up, thus marrying clinical accessibility with high precision to quantify specific tissues and to predict whole-body composition.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Blood transfusion is one of the most frequently used therapies worldwide and is associated with benefits, risks, and costs. OBJECTIVE: To develop a set of evidence-based recommendations for patient blood management (PBM) and for research. EVIDENCE REVIEW: The scientific committee developed 17 Population/Intervention/Comparison/Outcome (PICO) questions for red blood cell (RBC) transfusion in adult patients in 3 areas: preoperative anemia (3 questions), RBC transfusion thresholds (11 questions), and implementation of PBM programs (3 questions). These questions guided the literature search in 4 biomedical databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Transfusion Evidence Library), searched from inception to January 2018. Meta-analyses were conducted with the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) methodology and the Evidence-to-Decision framework by 3 panels including clinical and scientific experts, nurses, patient representatives, and methodologists, to develop clinical recommendations during a consensus conference in Frankfurt/Main, Germany, in April 2018. FINDINGS: From 17\,607 literature citations associated with the 17 PICO questions, 145 studies, including 63 randomized clinical trials with 23\,143 patients and 82 observational studies with more than 4 million patients, were analyzed. For preoperative anemia, 4 clinical and 3 research recommendations were developed, including the strong recommendation to detect and manage anemia sufficiently early before major elective surgery. For RBC transfusion thresholds, 4 clinical and 6 research recommendations were developed, including 2 strong clinical recommendations for critically ill but clinically stable intensive care patients with or without septic shock (recommended threshold for RBC transfusion, hemoglobin concentration {$<$}7 g/dL) as well as for patients undergoing cardiac surgery (recommended threshold for RBC transfusion, hemoglobin concentration {$<$}7.5 g/dL). For implementation of PBM programs, 2 clinical and 3 research recommendations were developed, including recommendations to implement comprehensive PBM programs and to use electronic decision support systems (both conditional recommendations) to improve appropriate RBC utilization. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The 2018 PBM International Consensus Conference defined the current status of the PBM evidence base for practice and research purposes and established 10 clinical recommendations and 12 research recommendations for preoperative anemia, RBC transfusion thresholds for adults, and implementation of PBM programs. The relative paucity of strong evidence to answer many of the PICO questions supports the need for additional research and an international consensus for accepted definitions and hemoglobin thresholds, as well as clinically meaningful end points for multicenter trials.},

We aimed to determine whether myosteatosis is associated with an increased risk of postoperative complications and reduced long-term survival after oesophago-gastric (OG) cancer surgery. METHODS: Patients who underwent radical OG cancer surgery with preoperative abdominal computed tomography (CT) imaging were included. Myosteatosis was evaluated using previously defined cut-points for low skeletal muscle attenuation measured by CT. Oncological, surgical, complications, and outcome data were obtained from a prospective database. RESULTS: Of 108 patients, 56\% (n\,=\,61) had myosteatosis. Patients with myosteatosis were older (69.1\,{$\pm$}\,9.1 vs. 62.8\,{$\pm$}\,9.8 years, p\,=\,0.001) and had a similar body mass index (BMI) (23.4\,{$\pm$}\,5.3 vs. 25.9\,{$\pm$}\,6.7\,kg/m2, p\,=\,0.766) compared to patients with normal muscle attenuation. Patients with myosteatosis had a higher rate of anastomotic leaks (15\% vs. 2\%, p\,=\,0.041). On multivariate analysis, myosteatosis was an independent predictor of overall (OR 3.03, 95\% CI 1.31-6.99, p\,=\,0.009) and severe complications (OR 4.33, 95\% CI 1.26-14.9, p\,=\,0.020). Patients with myosteatosis had reduced 5 year overall (54.1\% vs. 83\%, p\,=\,0.004) and disease-free (55.2\% vs. 87.2\%, p\,=\,0.007) survival. CONCLUSION: Myosteatosis is associated with a significantly increased risk of overall and severe complications as well as substantially reduced long-term survival. Assessment of muscle attenuation provides analysis beyond standard anthropometrics and may form part of preoperative physiological staging tools used to improve surgical outcomes.},

This study aimed to compare the gastrointestinal transit time of patients 1~year after esophagectomy with unoperated controls, including its relation to satiety gut hormone release. In this cross-sectional study, consecutive, disease-free patients after esophagectomy with pyloroplasty were compared with unoperated control subjects to assess gastric emptying (GE) and cecal arrival time (CAT). Serial plasma samples were collected before, and for 300~minutes after, a mixed-meal challenge. Body composition was assessed, and symptom scores were calculated. Eleven patients 1~year post-esophagectomy (age: 62.6\,{$\pm$}\,9.8, male: 82\%) did not show a significantly different GE pattern compared with 10 control subjects (P\,=\,0.245). Rather, patients could be categorized bimodally as exhibiting either rapid or slow GE relative to controls. Those with rapid GE trended toward a higher postprandial symptom burden (P\,=\,0.084) without higher postprandial glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion (P\,=\,0.931). CAT was significantly shorter after esophagectomy (P\,=\,0.043) but was not significantly associated with GE, GLP-1 secretion, or symptom burden. Neither early nutrient delivery to the proximal small intestine nor to the colon explains the exaggerated postprandial GLP-1 response after esophagectomy. GE varies significantly in these patients despite consistent pyloric management.},

The aim of the current study was to evaluate the prognostic potential of a skeletal muscle mass reduction index measured by computed tomography (CT) for mUC patients undergoing second-line gemcitabine and docetaxel (GD) chemotherapy. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 44 patients with mUC who received second-line GD chemotherapy between 2006 and 2015 in our hospital. Skeletal muscle area (SMA) at the third lumbar vertebra was measured using CT images obtained from medical records, and a skeletal muscle index (SMI) was calculated for each patient as: SMI = SMA / height2. Changes in SMI across timepoints (SMI inclination) were calculated as: SMI inclination = [( SMI/SMI)/duration of the interval between imaging visits]. Patients were then divided into two groups: a "steep" group (SMI inclination {$<$} -0.01) and a "gentle" group (SMI inclination {$\geq$} -0.01). Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to evaluate the relationship between SMI inclination and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: There were no differences in patient characteristics between the two groups with respect to median age, gender, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG-PS), disease control rate or first-line treatment regimen. OS from the start of second-line GD therapy group was significantly shorter in the "steep" group relative to the "gentle" group. The multivariate analysis revealed that "steep" SMI inclination and presence of anemia were strong predictors of poor prognosis. CONCLUSION: Higher values of SMI inclination, indicating a faster rate of skeletal muscle mass reduction, may serve as a useful predictive marker for OS in mUC patients undergoing second-line GD chemotherapy.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Open esophagectomy for cancer is a major oncological procedure, associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Recently, thoracoscopic procedures have offered a potentially advantageous alternative because of less operative trauma compared with thoracotomy. The aim of this study was to utilize meta-analysis to compare outcomes of open esophagectomy with those of minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) and hybrid minimally invasive esophagectomy (HMIE). METHODS: Literature search was performed using Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar databases for comparative studies assessing different techniques of esophagectomy. A random-effects model was used for meta-analysis, and heterogeneity was assessed. Primary outcomes of interest were 30-day mortality and anastomotic leak. Secondary outcomes included operative outcomes, other postoperative outcomes, and oncological outcomes in terms of lymph nodes retrieved. RESULTS: A total of 12 studies were included in the analysis. Studies included a total of 672 patients for MIE and HMIE, and 612 for open esophagectomy. There was no significant difference in 30-day mortality; however, MIE had lower blood loss, shorter hospital stay, and reduced total morbidity and respiratory complications. For all other outcomes, there was no significant difference between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Minimally invasive esophagectomy is a safe alternative to the open technique. Patients undergoing MIE may benefit from shorter hospital stay, and lower respiratory complications and total morbidity compared with open esophagectomy. Multicenter, prospective large randomized controlled trials are required to confirm these findings in order to base practice on sound clinical evidence.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Treatment of rectal cancer has changed dramatically over the last decade. The worldwide introduction of total mesorectal excision in combination with the increasing use of radio(chemo)-therapy has led to an improved prognosis. One of the main prognostic factors in rectal cancer is the circumferential resection margin (CRM). Since the initial description of its clinical importance in 1986, the involvement of this margin (also called lateral or radial resection margin) has been associated with a poor prognosis. METHODS: In the current review, the evidence for the importance of the CRM in more than 17,500 patients is reviewed, and the relevance of this assessment to modern treatment is assessed. RESULTS: We demonstrate that, after neoadjuvant therapy (both radiotherapy and radiochemotherapy), the predictive value of the CRM for local recurrence is significantly higher than when no preoperative therapy has been applied (hazard ratio [HR] = 6.3 v 2.0, respectively; P {$<$} .05). Furthermore, involvement of the CRM is a powerful predictor of both development of distant metastases (HR = 2.8; 95\% CI, 1.9 to 4.3) and survival (HR = 1.7; 95\% CI, 1.3 to 2.3). In addition to the prognostic data, this review describes different modes of margin involvement, exact definitions, and factors influencing its presence. CONCLUSION: CRM involvement is one of the key factors in rectal cancer treatment.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to elucidate the impact of sarcopenia in elderly patients with esophageal cancer on postoperative complications and long-term survival after surgery for esophageal cancer. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Sarcopenia, defined as loss of skeletal muscle mass with age, has been identified as a poor prognostic factor for malignancies. This retrospective study investigated the effect of sarcopenia on surgical outcomes among young and elderly patients with esophageal cancer. METHODS: Data were collected for 341 consecutive patients who underwent esophagectomy for esophageal cancer. Patients were assigned to 2 groups according to age (younger than 65 years and 65 years or older) and the presence of sarcopenia. RESULTS: Sarcopenia was present in 170 of 341 patients (49.9\%) with esophageal cancer and in 74 of 166 elderly patients (44.6\%). The incidence of anastomotic leak and in-hospital death was significantly higher in the elderly sarcopenia group than in the elderly nonsarcopenia group (31.5\% vs 15.2\%, P = 0.015, 6.8 vs 0.0\%, P = 0.037, respectively), and the overall survival rate in patients with sarcopenia correlated with a significantly poor prognosis in the elderly group (P {$<$} 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that sarcopenia was a risk factor for an anastomotic leak (P = 0.034) and was an unfavorable prognostic factor for survival (P {$<$} 0.001). Those correlations between sarcopenia and surgical outcomes were not observed in the young group. CONCLUSIONS: Sarcopenia and worse surgical outcomes were significantly associated patients with in esophageal cancer aged 65 years and older but not in those younger than 65 years.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postoperative changes in skeletal muscle and their influence on outcomes after esophagectomy for patients with esophageal cancer have not been fully investigated. This study aimed to confirm that postoperative skeletal muscle decrease influences long-term patient outcomes. METHODS: Data were collected from 218 patients who underwent curative esophagectomy for esophageal cancer whose data were available before and 6~months after surgery. The skeletal muscle index (SMI) was measured at the level of the L3 vertebrae, and the postoperative change in the SMI compared with preoperative values was calculated as the delta SMI. RESULTS: The mean SMI value was -\,11.64\%, and the median delta SMI value was -\,11.88\%. The first and third quartiles were defined as cutoffs, and 218 patients were classified as the mild-loss group (54 patients), moderate-loss group (110 patients), and severe-loss group (54 patients). The patients with a more severely reduced SMI had a worse prognosis (5-year overall survival rates: mild loss, 66.6\%; moderate loss, 58.8\%; and severe loss, 48.5\%; p\,=\,0.0314). This correlation between reduced SMI and prognosis also was observed for the patients with preoperative sarcopenia (p\,{$<$}\,0.0001), but not for those without preoperative sarcopenia. CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative reduced SMI and worse prognosis were significantly associated in esophageal cancer patients.},

  abstract = {Background Esophagogastric anastomosis after esophagectomy has been performed with a variety of techniques during the past decade. However, anastomotic leakage and stricture are still important clinical problems after esophagogastric anastomosis, causing burdensome symptoms and poor quality of life. Herein, we describe a novel cervical end-to-side triangulating esophagogastric anastomoasis using linear stapler. Methods A total of 90 patients (85 \% male; mean age 63 years) with thoracic esophageal cancer who underwent cervical end-to-side esophagogastric triangular anastomosis using a linear stapler after minimally invasive esophagectomy between November 2006 and April 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. Results The median operation time was 602 min (range 424\textendash 936 min). The volume of blood loss during the entire operative procedure was 127 ml (range 0\textendash 700 ml). There were no cases of anastomotic leakage in this study, although four patients (4.4 \%) developed dysphagia associated with benign anastomotic stricture formation. All patients with a benign anastomotic stricture underwent balloon dilation, which resulted in improvement in their symptoms. Conclusions Considering the absence of anastomotic leakage and low rate of anastomotic stricture formation in this study, our modified triangular esophagogastric anastomosis technique appears promising and may contribute to reduced morbidity and mortality rates following esophagectomy.},

Moreover, there are few reports about nomograms in inoperable locally advanced or metastatic gastric cancer (AGC), although several studies have been reported regarding other cancer types. This retrospective study aimed to develop nomograms that combine HER2 status and other prognostic factors to predict the survival outcomes of AGC patients starting first-line treatment. Methods In this study, 838 consecutive AGC patients starting first-line chemotherapy at the Aichi Cancer Center Hospital (ACC) were included to establish the nomograms that calculated the predicted probability of survival at different time points, 6 months and 1 and 2 years for overall survival (OS) and 3 and 6 months, and 1 year for progression free survival (PFS). Nomograms were independently validated with 269 consecutive AGC patients at the Cancer Center Hospital (SCC) who underwent first-line chemotherapy. The discriminatory ability and accuracy of the models were assessed using Harrell's c-index. IHC3+ or IHC2+/ISH+ tumors were defined as HER2 positive. Results At a median follow-up of 12.3 (ACC) and 11.6 (SCC) months, the median OS was 12.5 and 12.4 months (P=1.00), and the median PFS was 4.8 and 5.8 months (P=0.03), respectively. The nomograms showed good C-index values: OS was respectively 0.688 and 0.576 and PFS was respectively for 0.643 and 0.544. Conclusions The nomograms including HER2 status as covariate are crucial determinants of clinical care.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: While obesity is considered a prognostic factor in colorectal cancer (CRC), there is increasing evidence that not simply body mass index (BMI) alone but specifically abdominal fat distribution is what matters. As part of the ColoCare study, this study measured the distribution of adipose tissue compartments in CRC patients and aimed to identify the body metric that best correlates with these measurements as a useful proxy for adipose tissue distribution. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 120 newly-diagnosed CRC patients who underwent multidetector computed tomography (CT), densitometric quantification of total (TFA), visceral (VFA), intraperitoneal (IFA), retroperitoneal (RFA), and subcutaneous fat area (SFA), as well as the M. erector spinae and psoas was performed to test the association with gender, age, tumor stage, metabolic equivalents, BMI, waist-to-height (WHtR) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR). RESULTS: VFA was 28.8 \% higher in men (pVFA{$<$}0.0001) and 30.5 \% higher in patients older than 61 years (pVFA{$<$}0.0001). WHtR correlated best with all adipose tissue compartments (rVFA=0.69, rTFA=0.84, p{$<$}0.0001) and visceral-to-subcutaneous-fat-ratio (VFR, rVFR=0.22, p={$<$}0.05). Patients with tumor stages III/IV showed significantly lower overall adipose tissue than I/II. Increased M. erector spinae mass was inversely correlated with all compartments. CONCLUSION: Densitometric quantification on CT is a highly reproducible and reliable method to show fat distribution across adipose tissue compartments. This distribution might be best reflected by WHtR, rather than by BMI or WHR. KEY POINTS: \textbullet{} Densitometric quantification of adipose tissue on CT is highly reproducible and reliable. \textbullet{} Waist-to-height ratio better correlates with adipose tissue compartments and VFR than BMI or waist-to-hip ratio. \textbullet{} Men have higher a higher visceral fat area than women. \textbullet{} Patients older than 61 years have higher visceral fat area. \textbullet{} Patients with tumor stages III/IV have significantly lower adipose tissue than those in stages I/II.},

We implemented the guideline in a single provincial healthcare system, and our study examined the effect of the guideline on patient outcomes [length of stay (LOS), complications, and 30-day post-discharge readmissions] across a healthcare system. METHODS: We compared pre- and post-guideline implementation in consecutive elective colorectal patients, {$\geq$} 18 years, from six Alberta hospitals between February 2013 and December 2014. Participants were followed up to 30 days post discharge. We used summary statistics, to assess the LOS and complications, and multivariate regression methods to assess readmissions and to estimate cost impacts. RESULTS: A total of 1333 patients (350 pre- and 983 post-ERAS) were analysed. Of this number, 55 \% were males. Median overall guideline compliance was 39 \% in pre- and 60 \% in post-ERAS patients. Median LOS was 6 days for pre-ERAS compared to 4.5 days in post-ERAS patients with the longest implementation (p value {$<$}0.0001). Adjusted risk ratio (RR) was 1.71, 95 \% CI 1.09-2.68 for 30-day readmission, comparing pre- to post-ERAS patients. The proportion of patients who developed at least one complication was significantly reduced, from pre- to post-ERAS, difference in proportions = 11.7 \%, 95 \% CI 2.5-21.0, p value: 0.0139. The net cost savings attributable to guideline implementation ranged between \$2806 and \$5898 USD per patient. CONCLUSION: The findings in our study have shown that ERAS colorectal guideline implementation within a healthcare system resulted in patient outcome improvements, similar to those obtained in smaller standalone implementations. There was a significant beneficial impact of ERAS on scarce health system resources.},

The role of the driving pressure, which is the difference between the plateau pressure and the level of positive end-expiratory pressure is not known. We investigated the association of tidal volume, the level of PEEP, and driving pressure during intraoperative ventilation with the development of postoperative pulmonary complications. METHODS: We did a meta-analysis of individual patient data from randomised controlled trials of protective ventilation during general anesthaesia for surgery published up to July 30, 2015. The main outcome was development of postoperative pulmonary complications (postoperative lung injury, pulmonary infection, or barotrauma). FINDINGS: We included data from 17 randomised controlled trials, including 2250 patients. Multivariate analysis suggested that driving pressure was associated with the development of postoperative pulmonary complications (odds ratio [OR] for one unit increase of driving pressure 1{$\cdot$}16, 95\% CI 1{$\cdot$}13-1{$\cdot$}19; p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001), whereas we detected no association for tidal volume (1{$\cdot$}05, 0{$\cdot$}98-1{$\cdot$}13; p=0{$\cdot$}179). PEEP did not have a large enough effect in univariate analysis to warrant inclusion in the multivariate analysis. In a mediator analysis, driving pressure was the only significant mediator of the effects of protective ventilation on development of pulmonary complications (p=0{$\cdot$}027). In two studies that compared low with high PEEP during low tidal volume ventilation, an increase in the level of PEEP that resulted in an increase in driving pressure was associated with more postoperative pulmonary complications (OR 3{$\cdot$}11, 95\% CI 1{$\cdot$}39-6{$\cdot$}96; p=0{$\cdot$}006). INTERPRETATION: In patients having surgery, intraoperative high driving pressure and changes in the level of PEEP that result in an increase of driving pressure are associated with more postoperative pulmonary complications. However, a randomised controlled trial comparing ventilation based on driving pressure with usual care is needed to confirm these findings. FUNDING: None.},

  abstract = {Background. Although muscle strength and mass are highly correlated, the relationship between direct measures of low muscle mass (sarcopenia) and strength in association with mortality has not been examined. Methods. Total mortality rates were examined in the Health, Aging and Body Composition (Health ABC) Study in 2292 participants (aged 70\textendash 79 years, 51.6\% women, and 38.8\% black). Knee extension strength was measured with isokinetic dynamometry, grip strength with isometric dynamometry. Thigh muscle area was measured by computed tomography (CT) scan, and leg and arm lean soft tissue mass were determined by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Both strength and muscle size were assessed as in gender-specific Cox proportional hazards models, with age, race, comorbidities, smoking status, level of physical activity, fat area by CT or fat mass by DXA, height, and markers of inflammation, including interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, and tumor necrosis factor-a considered as potential confounders. Results. There were 286 deaths over an average of 4.9 (standard deviation {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.9) years of follow-up. Both quadriceps and grip strength were strongly related to mortality. For quadriceps strength (per standard deviation of 38 Nm), the crude hazard ratio for men was 1.51 (95\% confidence interval, 1.28\textendash 1.79) and 1.65 (95\% confidence interval, 1.19\textendash 2.30) for women. Muscle size, determined by either CT area or DXA regional lean mass, was not strongly related to mortality. In the models of quadriceps strength and mortality, adjustment for muscle area or regional lean mass only slightly attenuated the associations. Further adjustment for other factors also had minimal effect on the association of quadriceps strength with mortality. Associations of grip strength with mortality were similar. Conclusion. Low muscle mass did not explain the strong association of strength with mortality, demonstrating that muscle strength as a marker of muscle quality is more important than quantity in estimating mortality risk. Grip strength provided risk estimates similar to those of quadriceps strength.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pre-operative anaemia is common and occurs in up to 76\% of patients. It is associated with increased peri-operative allogeneic blood transfusions, longer hospital lengths of stay and increased morbidity and mortality. Iron deficiency is one of the most common causes of this anaemia. Oral iron therapy has traditionally been used to treat anaemia but newer, safer parenteral iron preparations have been shown to be more effective in other conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, chronic heart failure and post-partum haemorrhage. A limited number of studies look at iron therapy for the treatment of pre-operative anaemia. The aim of this Cochrane review is to summarise the evidence for use of iron supplementation, both enteral and parenteral, for the management of pre-operative anaemia. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review is to evaluate the effects of pre-operative iron therapy (enteral or parenteral) in reducing the need for allogeneic blood transfusions in anaemic patients undergoing surgery. SEARCH METHODS: We ran the search on 25 March 2015. We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group's Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library), Ovid MEDLINE(R), Ovid MEDLINE(R) In-Process \& Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE(R) Daily and Ovid OLDMEDLINE(R), EMBASE Classic and EMBASE (Ovid), CINAHL Plus (EBSCO), PubMed, clinical trials registries, conference abstracts, and we screened reference lists. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which compared pre-operative iron monotherapy to placebo, no treatment, standard of care or another form of iron therapy for anaemic adults undergoing surgery. Anaemia was defined by haemoglobin values less than 13 g/dL for males and 12 g/dL for non-pregnant females. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were collected by two authors on the proportion of patients who receive a blood transfusion, amount of blood transfused per patient (units) and haemoglobin measured as continuous variables at pre-determined time-points: pre-treatment, pre-operatively but post-treatment, and post-operatively. Statistical analysis was performed using the Cochrane statistical software, Review Manager 2014. Outcome data were summarised in tables and a forest plot. MAIN RESULTS: Three prospective randomised controlled studies evaluated pre-operative iron therapy to correct anaemia (two in colorectal and one in gynaecological surgery) and included 114 patients in total. One compared oral iron versus standard care (Lidder 2007); one intravenous iron versus control (Edwards 2009); and one study compared oral versus intravenous iron (Kim 2009). Both colorectal trials reported the primary outcome (proportion of patients who received allogeneic blood transfusions) and meta-analysis showed a reduction in blood transfusions with the administration of iron therapy, but the reduction was not statistically significant (risk ratio (RR) 0.56, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.27 to 1.18). All studies reported haemoglobin change but data for the anaemic patients were only available for two studies (Edwards 2009 and Kim 2009). Edwards 2009 showed no difference in haemoglobin at the end of treatment pre-operatively. The intravenous versus oral iron study showed an increase in haemoglobin with intravenous iron at the end of treatment pre-operatively (MD 1.90 g/dL, 95\% CI 1.16 to 2.64; participants = 56), but the results are at high risk of bias because participants with less than 80\% compliance with therapy were excluded from the analysis and compliance was lower in the oral iron group due to the side-effects of treatment (Kim 2009).None of the studies reported quality of life, short- or long-term mortality or post-operative morbidity. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The use of iron therapy for pre-operative anaemia does not show a statistically significant reduction in the proportion of patients who received an allogeneic blood transfusion compared to no iron therapy. However, the 38 patients in our analysis falls far short of the 819 patients our information size calculation recommended to detect a 30\% reduction in blood transfusions. Intravenous iron may be more effective than oral iron at increasing haemoglobin. However, all these conclusions are drawn from only three small randomised controlled studies. Further well designed, adequately powered randomised controlled studies are required to determine the true effectiveness of iron therapy for pre-operative anaemia.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIM: Esophagectomy and gastrectomy are procedures with considerable physical burden and intense post-operative care of which the patient's physical condition seems to be a relevant predictor. The gold standard of the cardiorespiratory fitness is the peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak). This pilot study examined the prognostic value of VO2peak on post-surgery outcomes in esophageal and gastric cancer patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this prospective cross-sectional study, patients scheduled for esophagectomy or gastrectomy were examined 24 h before the surgery regarding their VO2peak. The post-operative complications according to Clavien-Dindo grade IIIb/IV/V, Intensive-Care-Unit days, and overall hospital stay were documented following surgery. In a subset, body weight changes from surgery until hospital discharge and first aftercare visit were recorded. RESULTS: The functional capacity was significantly reduced in 34/35 of the included patients compared to matched norm-values (p{$<$}0.01). The only significant correlation was found between VO2peak values and body weight change from surgery to the first aftercare visit. A subgroup comparison of patients with a VO2peak {$<$}17 ml/min/kg and {$\geq$}17 ml/min/kg suggested small, non-significant differences in post-surgery outcomes and significant differences in the body weight change from surgery to hospital discharge, favoring the higher-VO2peak subgroup. CONCLUSION: The impaired functional capacity following esophagectomy or gastrectomy may strengthen the rational for exercise programs during neoadjuvant and pre-surgery phases. The prognostic value of VO2peak on post-operative outcomes remains uncertain due to noticeable descriptive differences, but no significant correlations, potentially limited by the smallsized population. Nonetheless, a correlation between VO2peak and body weight change post-surgery was observed and indicates a potential prognostic value of VO2peak.},

This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the impact of relative dose intensity (RDI) on survival in adult patients with solid tumor cancer on nonadjuvant-based chemotherapy regimens. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases were searched for peer-reviewed English journal articles or congress abstracts evaluating association between RDI and survival; observational studies, case series of {$\geq$}20 patients, and clinical trials published between 2013 and 2020 were eligible. Meta-analyses were conducted to quantify the association between RDI levels and overall survival (OS) among studies reporting a hazard ratio (HR) for OS by similar tumor types, regimens, and RDI. Forest plots represented summary HR and 95\% confidence interval (CI); Cochran's Q and I2 tests evaluated study heterogeneity. RESULTS: Overall, 919 articles were reviewed and 22 included; seven were eligible for meta-analysis. Significantly shorter OS at RDI {$<$}80\% versus {$\geq$}80\% and~{$<$}85\% versus {$\geq$}85\% was observed upon meta-analysis of four carboplatin-based studies for breast, non-small cell lung, or ovarian cancer (HR 1.17; 95\% CI: 1.07-1.27) and three FOLFOX-, FOLFIRI-, or FOLFIRINOX-based studies for colorectal or pancreatic cancer (HR 1.39; 95\% CI: 1.03-1.89). Grade 3 or higher hematologic toxicities were higher for carboplatin-based regimens (thrombocytopenia: 14\%-22\%; anemia: 15\%-19\%; neutropenia: 24\%-58\%) than FOLFOX-, FOLFIRI-, or FOLFIRINOX-based regimens (thrombocytopenia: 1\%-4\%; anemia: 5\%-19\%; neutropenia: 19\%-47\%). CONCLUSION: The results suggested longer OS with RDI {$\geq$}80\% or~{$\geq$}85\% for both regimens, indicating that management of toxicities across treatment modalities may contribute to maintenance of higher RDI and benefit survival for patients with advanced solid tumors. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Chemotherapy-induced toxicities lead to dose reduction and/or treatment delay, thus affecting patient outcomes. Results of this systematic review and meta-analysis, evaluating the impact of relative dose intensity (RDI) on survival of patients with solid tumors on nonadjuvant-based chemotherapy regimens, demonstrate a longer overall survival with RDI levels of at least 80\% for patients with solid tumors on carboplatin-based and FOLFOX-, FOLFIRI-, or FOLFIRINOX-based chemotherapy regimens, suggesting a protective effect of maintaining RDI {$\geq$}80\% or~{$\geq$}\,-85\%. Although grade 3 or higher hematologic toxicities occurred more in carboplatin-based studies, managing toxicities across treatment regimens may contribute to maintenance of higher RDI and ultimately benefit overall survival.},

The planned interim analysis of CLASSIC (median follow-up 34 months) showed that adjuvant capecitabine plus oxaliplatin significantly improved disease-free survival, the primary endpoint, compared with observation after D2 gastrectomy. We report the 5-year follow-up data from the trial. METHODS: CLASSIC was a phase 3, randomised, open-label study done at 35 cancer centres, medical centres, and hospitals in China, South Korea, and Taiwan. Patients with stage II-IIIB gastric cancer who underwent curative D2 gastrectomy were randomly assigned (1:1) after surgery to receive adjuvant chemotherapy with capecitabine and oxaliplatin (eight 3-week cycles of oral capecitabine 1000 mg/m(2) twice daily on days 1-14 plus intravenous oxaliplatin 130 mg/m(2) on day 1) for 6 months or observation alone. Randomisation was stratified by country and disease stage with a permuted block (size four) design. Neither patients nor investigators were masked to treatment assignment. The primary outcome was 3-year disease-free survival in the intention-to-treat population. This analysis presents the final preplanned assessment of outcomes after 5 years. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00411229. FINDINGS: We enrolled 1035 patients: 520 were randomly assigned to adjuvant capecitabine and oxaliplatin, and 515 to observation. Median follow-up for this analysis in the intention-to-treat population was 62{$\cdot$}4 months (IQR 54-70). 139 (27\%) patients had disease-free survival events in the adjuvant capecitabine and oxaliplatin group versus 203 (39\%) patients in the observation group (stratified hazard ratio [HR] 0{$\cdot$}58, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}47-0{$\cdot$}72; p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001). Estimated 5-year disease-free survival was 68\% (95\% CI 63-73) in the adjuvant capecitabine and oxaliplatin group versus 53\% (47-58) in the observation alone group. By the clinical cutoff date, 103 patients (20\%) had died in the adjuvant capecitabine and oxaliplatin group versus 141 patients (27\%) in the observation group (stratified HR 0{$\cdot$}66, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}51-0{$\cdot$}85; p=0{$\cdot$}0015). Estimated 5-year overall survival was 78\% (95\% CI 74-82) in the adjuvant capecitabine and oxaliplatin group versus 69\% (64-73) in the observation group. Adverse event data were not collected after the primary analysis. INTERPRETATION: Adjuvant treatment with capecitabine plus oxaliplatin after D2 gastrectomy should be considered for patients with operable stage II or III gastric cancer.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) plus surgery is a standard treatment for locally advanced oesophageal cancer. With this treatment, 29\% of patients have a pathologically complete response in the resection specimen. This provides the rationale for investigating an active surveillance approach. The aim of this study is to assess the (cost-)effectiveness of active surveillance vs. standard oesophagectomy after nCRT for oesophageal cancer. METHODS: This is a phase-III multi-centre, stepped-wedge cluster randomised controlled trial. A total of 300 patients with clinically complete response (cCR, i.e. no local or disseminated disease proven by histology) after nCRT will be randomised to show non-inferiority of active surveillance to standard oesophagectomy (non-inferiority margin 15\%, intra-correlation coefficient 0.02, power 80\%, 2-sided {$\alpha$} 0.05, 12\% drop-out). Patients will undergo a first clinical response evaluation (CRE-I) 4-6~weeks after nCRT, consisting of endoscopy with bite-on-bite biopsies of the primary tumour site and other suspected lesions. Clinically complete responders will undergo a second CRE (CRE-II), 6-8~weeks after CRE-I. CRE-II will include 18F-FDG-PET-CT, followed by endoscopy with bite-on-bite biopsies and ultra-endosonography plus fine needle aspiration of suspected lymph nodes and/or PET- positive lesions. Patients with cCR at CRE-II will be assigned to oesophagectomy (first phase) or active surveillance (second phase of the study). The duration of the first phase is determined randomly over the 12 centres, i.e., stepped-wedge cluster design. Patients in the active surveillance arm will undergo diagnostic evaluations similar to CRE-II at 6/9/12/16/20/24/30/36/48 and 60~months after nCRT. In this arm, oesophagectomy will be offered only to patients in whom locoregional regrowth is highly suspected or proven, without distant dissemination. The main study parameter is overall survival; secondary endpoints include percentage of patients who do not undergo surgery, quality of life, clinical irresectability (cT4b) rate, radical resection rate, postoperative complications, progression-free survival, distant dissemination rate, and cost-effectiveness. We hypothesise that active surveillance leads to non-inferior survival, improved quality of life and a reduction in costs, compared to standard oesophagectomy. DISCUSSION: If active surveillance and surgery as needed after nCRT leads to non-inferior survival compared to standard oesophagectomy, this organ-sparing approach can be implemented as a standard of care.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: After neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for oesophageal cancer, roughly half of the patients with squamous cell carcinoma and a quarter of those with adenocarcinoma have a pathological complete response of the primary tumour before surgery. Thus, the necessity of standard oesophagectomy after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy should be reconsidered for patients who respond sufficiently to neoadjuvant treatment. In this study, we aimed to establish the accuracy of detection of residual disease after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy with different diagnostic approaches, and the optimal combination of diagnostic techniques for clinical response evaluations. METHODS: The preSANO trial was a prospective, multicentre, diagnostic cohort study at six centres in the Netherlands. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, had histologically proven, resectable, squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus or oesophagogastric junction, and were eligible for potential curative therapy with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (five weekly cycles of carboplatin [area under the curve 2 mg/mL per min] plus paclitaxel [50 mg/m2 of body-surface area] combined with 41{$\cdot$}4 Gy radiotherapy in 23 fractions) followed by oesophagectomy. 4-6 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, patients had oesophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsies and endoscopic ultrasonography with measurement of maximum tumour thickness. Patients with histologically proven locoregional residual disease or no-pass during endoscopy and without distant metastases underwent immediate surgical resection. In the remaining patients a second clinical response evaluation was done (PET-CT, oesophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsies, endoscopic ultrasonography with measurement of maximum tumour thickness, and fine-needle aspiration of suspicious lymph nodes), followed by surgery 12-14 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. The primary endpoint was the correlation between clinical response during clinical response evaluations and the final pathological response in resection specimens, as shown by the proportion of tumour regression grade (TRG) 3 or 4 ({$>$}10\% residual carcinoma in the resection specimen) residual tumours that was missed during clinical response evaluations. This study was registered with the Netherlands Trial Register (NTR4834), and has been completed. FINDINGS: Between July 22, 2013, and Dec 28, 2016, 219 patients were included, 207 of whom were included in the analyses. Eight of 26 TRG3 or TRG4 tumours (31\% [95\% CI 17-50]) were missed by endoscopy with regular biopsies and fine-needle aspiration. Four of 41 TRG3 or TRG4 tumours (10\% [95\% CI 4-23]) were missed with bite-on-bite biopsies and fine-needle aspiration. Endoscopic ultrasonography with maximum tumour thickness measurement missed TRG3 or TRG4 residual tumours in 11 of 39 patients (28\% [95\% CI 17-44]). PET-CT missed six of 41 TRG3 or TRG4 tumours (15\% [95\% CI 7-28]). PET-CT detected interval distant histologically proven metastases in 18 (9\%) of 190 patients (one squamous cell carcinoma, 17 adenocarcinomas). INTERPRETATION: After neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for oesophageal cancer, clinical response evaluation with endoscopic ultrasonography, bite-on-bite biopsies, and fine-needle aspiration of suspicious lymph nodes was adequate for detection of locoregional residual disease, with PET-CT for detection of interval metastases. Active surveillance with this combination of diagnostic modalities is now being assessed in a phase 3 randomised controlled trial (SANO trial; Netherlands Trial Register NTR6803).

BACKGROUND: The application of neoadjuvant therapy might change the association between the extent of lymphadenectomy and survival in patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma. This may influence the choice of surgical approach in patients treated with nCRT. METHODS: Patients with potentially curable subcarinal esophageal adenocarcinoma treated with surgery alone or nCRT followed by surgery in 7 centers were included. The effect of surgical approach on overall survival, differentiated by the addition or omission of nCRT, was analyzed using a multivariable Cox regression model that included well-known prognostic factors and factors that might have influenced the choice of surgical approach. RESULTS: In total, 701 patients were included, of whom 318 had TTE with extended lymphadenectomy and 383 had THE with limited lymphadenectomy. TTE had differential effects on survival (P for interaction = 0.02), with a more favorable prognostic effect in patients who were treated with surgery alone [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.77, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.58-1.03]. This association was statistically significant in a subgroup of patients with 1 to 8 positive lymph nodes in the resection specimen (HR = 0.62, 95\% CI 0.43-0.90). The favorable prognostic effect of TTE over THE was absent in the nCRT and surgery group (HR = 1.16, 95\% CI 0.80-1.66) and in the subgroup of nCRT patients with 1 to 8 positive lymph nodes in the resection specimen (HR = 1.00, 95\% CI 0.61-1.68). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to surgery alone, the addition of nCRT may reduce the need for TTE with extended lymphadenectomy to improve long-term survival in patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer worldwide, with a median age of 72-75 years at diagnosis. Curative treatment usually involves surgery; if left untreated, symptoms may require emergency surgery. Therefore, most patients will be accepted for surgery, despite of high age or comorbidity. It is known that elderly patients suffer higher risks after surgery than younger patients, in terms of complications and mortality. Assessing frailty and offering frail elderly patients individualized treatment according to the comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) and care concept has been shown to improve the outcome for frail elderly patients in other clinical contexts. METHODS: This randomized controlled multicentre trial aims to investigate if CGA and care prior to curatively intended surgery for CRC in frail elderly patients will improve postoperative outcome. All patients {$\geq$} 70 years with surgically curable CRC will be screened for frailty using the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS-9). Frail patients will be offered inclusion. Randomization is stratified for colon or rectal cancer. Patients in the intervention group are, in addition to standard protocol, treated according to CGA and care. This consists of individualized assessments and interventions, established by a multiprofessional team. Patients in the control group are treated according to best known practice as stipulated by Swedish colorectal cancer treatment guidelines, within an enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) setting. The primary outcome is 90-day mortality. Secondary outcomes are the length of hospital stay and total number of hospital days within 3 months, discharge destination, 30-day readmission, ADL, safe medication assessment, CFS-9 score, complications, Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) at 2-month follow-up in comparison to baseline measurements, health economical calculations including cost-effectiveness analysis based on costs of hospital care and primary care, mortality and HRQoL at baseline, 2- and 12-month follow-up and all-cause 1-year mortality. DISCUSSION: The trial is the first of its size and extent to investigate intervention with CGA and care prior to surgery for CRC in frail elderly patients. If this addition proves to be favourable, it could have implications on future care of frail elderly patients with CRC. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04358328.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To develop a pipeline for automated body composition analysis and skeletal muscle assessment with integrated quality control for large-scale application in opportunistic imaging. METHODS: First, a convolutional neural network for extraction of a single slice at the L3/L4 lumbar level was developed on CT scans of 240 patients applying the nnU-Net framework. Second, a 2D competitive dense fully convolutional U-Net for segmentation of visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue (VAT, SAT), skeletal muscle (SM), and subsequent determination of fatty muscle fraction (FMF) was developed on single CT slices of 1143 patients. For both steps, automated quality control was integrated by a logistic regression model classifying the presence of L3/L4 and a linear regression model predicting the segmentation quality in terms of Dice score. To evaluate the performance of the entire pipeline end-to-end, body composition metrics, and FMF were compared to manual analyses including 364 patients from two centers. RESULTS: Excellent results were observed for slice extraction (z-deviation\,=\,2.46\,{$\pm$}\,6.20~mm) and segmentation (Dice score for SM\,=\,0.95\,{$\pm$}\,0.04, VAT\,=\,0.98\,{$\pm$}\,0.02, SAT\,=\,0.97\,{$\pm$}\,0.04) on the dual-center test set excluding cases with artifacts due to metallic implants. No data were excluded for end-to-end performance analyses. With a restrictive setting of the integrated segmentation quality control, 39 of 364 patients were excluded containing 8 cases with metallic implants. This setting ensured a high agreement between manual and fully automated analyses with mean relative area deviations of {$\Delta$}SM\,=\,3.3\,{$\pm$}\,4.1\%, {$\Delta$}VAT\,=\,3.0\,{$\pm$}\,4.7\%, {$\Delta$}SAT\,=\,2.7\,{$\pm$}\,4.3\%, and {$\Delta$}FMF\,=\,4.3\,{$\pm$}\,4.4\%. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents an end-to-end automated deep learning pipeline for large-scale opportunistic assessment of body composition metrics and sarcopenia biomarkers in clinical routine. KEY POINTS: \textbullet{} Body composition metrics and skeletal muscle quality can be opportunistically determined from routine abdominal CT scans. \textbullet{} A pipeline consisting of two convolutional neural networks allows an end-to-end automated analysis. \textbullet{} Machine-learning-based quality control ensures high agreement between manual and automatic analysis.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Endoscopic resection (ER) is an important advance in the management of esophageal tumors. It has been used successfully for superficial esophageal cancer and high-grade dysplasia (HGD) arising out of Barrett epithelium. METHODS: From a single institution within the Department of Surgery, patients who underwent ER for esophageal tumors between December 2001 and January 2012 were evaluated. Demographic, clinical, and pathologic variables were collected and reviewed. RESULTS: We identified 81 patients who underwent ER for esophageal lesions. Median patient age was 69 years, and the median follow-up was 3.25 years. In patients with HGD, at the time of last endoscopy, the complete eradication rate of HGD was 84 \% and cancer-specific survival was 100 \%. During surveillance, one patient developed an invasive carcinoma that required endoscopic therapy. Patients with T1a and negative deep margins on ER had a recurrence-free and cancer-specific survival of 100 \%. There were seven patients with T1b and negative margins on ER. Three patients underwent esophagectomy; final pathology revealed no residual malignancy or lymph node metastasis. Two patients had definitive chemoradiation, and two patients were observed. To date, there has been no cancer recurrence. In all patients who underwent ER, there was one episode of bleeding that required endoscopic treatment and admission for observation. CONCLUSIONS: ER can be performed safely and can adequately stage and often treat patients with HGD and superficial cancers. Patients with HGD and T1a disease with negative margins are cured with ER alone. Observation and surveillance may be an option for select patients with low-risk, early submucosal disease (T1b) and negative margins.},

Using the National Cancer Database, we investigated racial disparities in treatment and outcome of esophageal cancer patients. The National Cancer Database was queried from 2004 to 2017. Logistic regression and survival analysis were used to determine racial differences in access, treatment and outcome. A total of 127,098 patients were included. All minority groups were more likely to be diagnosed at advanced stages versus Caucasians after adjusting for covariates (African American OR-1.64 [95\% confidence interval 1.53-1.76], Hispanic OR-1.19 [1.08-1.32], Asian OR-1.78 [1.55-2.06]). After adjustment, all minorities were less likely at every stage to receive surgery. Despite these disparities, Hispanics and Asians had improved survival compared with Caucasians. African Americans had worse survival. Racial disparities for receiving surgery were present in both academic and community institutions, and at high-volume and low-volume institutions. Surgery partially mediated the survival difference between African Americans and Caucasians (HR-1.13 [1.10-1.16] and HR-1.04 [1.02-1.07], without and with adjustment of surgery).There are racial disparities in the treatment of esophageal cancer. Despite these disparities, Hispanics and Asians have improved overall survival versus Caucasians. African Americans have the worst overall survival. Racial disparities likely affect outcome in esophageal cancer. But other factors, such as epigenetics and tumor biology, may correlate more strongly with outcome for patients with esophageal cancer.},

The impact of muscle quality on outcomes, however, is unclear. This retrospective study investigated the impact of preoperative skeletal muscle quantity and quality on survival in patients undergoing resection of pancreatic cancer. Methods. We investigated 230 patients who underwent resection of pancreatic cancer between 2004 and 2013. The quantity and quality of skeletal muscle, indicated by psoas muscle mass index (PMI) and intramuscular adipose tissue content (IMAC), were measured in preoperative computed tomography images. Overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates were compared according to PMI and IMAC, and prognostic factors after pancreatic resection were assessed. Results. The OS and RFS rates in patients with low PMI were lesser than in those with normal/high PMI (P {$<$} .001, P {$<$} .001), with a mean survival time of 17.7 and 33.2 months, respectively. The OS and RFS rates in patients with high IMAC also were less than in those with normal/low IMAC (P {$<$} .001, P = .003) (mean survival time = 21.5 and 56.5 months, respectively).

DESIGN: Prospective consecutive series in which all patients underwent cardiopulmonary exercise (CPX) testing. SETTING: CPX laboratory and level 3 ICU and high-dependency unit (HDU) of a metropolitan teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Five hundred forty-eight patients {$>$}60 years of age (or younger with known cardiopulmonary disease) scheduled for major intra-abdominal surgery. INTERVENTIONS: The patients were assigned to one of three management strategies (ICU, HDU, or ward) based on the anaerobic threshold (deltaT) and ECG evidence of myocardial ischemia as determined by CPX testing that was performed as part of the presurgery evaluation, and by the expected oxygen demand stress of the surgical procedure. RESULTS: Overall mortality was 3.9\%. Forty-three percent of deaths were attributed to poor cardiopulmonary function, as detected preoperatively. There were no deaths related to cardiopulmonary complications in any patient deemed fit for major abdominal surgery and ward management, as determined by CPX testing. CONCLUSIONS: In elderly patients undergoing major intra-abdominal surgery, the AT, as determined by CPX testing, is an excellent predictor of mortality from cardiopulmonary causes in the postoperative period. Preoperative screening using CPX testing allowed the identification of high-risk patients and the appropriate selection of perioperative management.},

BACKGROUND: A randomized trial was performed to compare surgical techniques. Complete 5-year survival data are now available. METHODS: A total of 220 patients with adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus (type I) or gastric cardia involving the distal esophagus (type II) were randomly assigned to limited transhiatal esophagectomy or to extended transthoracic esophagectomy with en bloc lymphadenectomy. Patients with peroperatively irresectable/incurable cancer were excluded from this analysis (n = 15). A total of 95 patients underwent transhiatal esophagectomy and 110 patients underwent transthoracic esophagectomy. RESULTS: After transhiatal and transthoracic resection, 5-year survival was 34\% and 36\%, respectively (P = 0.71, per protocol analysis). In a subgroup analysis, based on the location of the primary tumor according to the resection specimen, no overall survival benefit for either surgical approach was seen in 115 patients with a type II tumor (P = 0.81). In 90 patients with a type I tumor, a survival benefit of 14\% was seen with the transthoracic approach (51\% vs. 37\%, P = 0.33). There was evidence that the treatment effect differed depending on the number of positive lymph nodes in the resection specimen (test for interaction P = 0.06). In patients (n = 55) without positive nodes locoregional disease-free survival after transhiatal esophagectomy was comparable to that after transthoracic esophagectomy (86\% and 89\%, respectively). The same was true for patients (n = 46) with more than 8 positive nodes (0\% in both groups). Patients (n = 104) with 1 to 8 positive lymph nodes in the resection specimen showed a 5-year locoregional disease-free survival advantage if operated via the transthoracic route (23\% vs. 64\%, P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: There is no significant overall survival benefit for either approach. However, compared with limited transhiatal resection extended transthoracic esophagectomy for type I esophageal adenocarcinoma shows an ongoing trend towards better 5-year survival. Moreover, patients with a limited number of positive lymph nodes in the resection specimen seem to benefit from an extended transthoracic esophagectomy.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To analyze recurrence patterns in patients with cancer of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction treated with either preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) plus surgery or surgery alone. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Recurrence pattern was analyzed in patients from the previously published CROSS I and II trials in relation to radiation target volumes. CRT consisted of five weekly courses of paclitaxel and carboplatin combined with a concurrent radiation dose of 41.4 Gy in 1.8-Gy fractions to the tumor and pathologic lymph nodes with margin. RESULTS: Of the 422 patients included from 2001 to 2008, 418 were available for analysis. Histology was mostly adenocarcinoma (75\%). Of the 374 patients who underwent resection, 86\% were allocated to surgery and 92\% to CRT plus surgery. On January 1, 2011, after a minimum follow-up of 24 months (median, 45 months), the overall recurrence rate in the surgery arm was 58\% versus 35\% in the CRT plus surgery arm. Preoperative CRT reduced locoregional recurrence (LRR) from 34\% to 14\% (P {$<$} .001) and peritoneal carcinomatosis from 14\% to 4\% (P {$<$} .001). There was a small but significant effect on hematogenous dissemination in favor of the CRT group (35\% v 29\%; P = .025). LRR occurred in 5\% within the target volume, in 2\% in the margins, and in 6\% outside the radiation target volume. In 1\%, the exact site in relation to the target volume was unclear. Only 1\% had an isolated infield recurrence after CRT plus surgery. CONCLUSION: Preoperative CRT in patients with esophageal cancer reduced LRR and peritoneal carcinomatosis. Recurrence within the radiation target volume occurred in only 5\%, mostly combined with outfield failures.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Frailty is a key determinant of clinical outcomes. We sought to describe frailty among U.S. Veterans and its association with mortality. METHODS: Nationwide retrospective cohort study of regular Veterans Affairs (VA) users, aged at least 65 years in 2002-2012, followed through 2014, using national VA administrative and Medicare and Medicaid data. A frailty index (FI) for VA (VA-FI) was calculated using the cumulative deficit method. Thirty-one age-related deficits in health from diagnostic and procedure codes were included and were updated biennially. Survival analysis assessed associations between VA-FI and mortality. RESULTS: A VA-FI was calculated for 2,837,152 Veterans over 10 years. In 2002, 35.5\% were non-frail (FI = 0-0.10), 32.6\% were pre-frail (FI = 0.11-0.20), 18.9\% were mildly frail (FI = 0.21-0.30), 8.7\% were moderately frail (FI = 0.31-0.40), and 4.3\% were severely frail (FI {$>$} 0.40). From 2002 to 2012, the prevalence of moderate frailty increased to 12.7\%and severe frailty to 14.1\%. Frailty was strongly associated with survival and was independent of age, sex, race, and smoking; the VA-FI better predicted mortality than age alone. Although prevalence of frailty rose over time, compared to non-frail Veterans, 2 years' hazard ratios (95\% confidence intervals) for mortality declined from a peak in 2004 of 2.01 (1.97-2.04), 3.49 (3.44-3.55), 5.88 (5.79-5.97), and 10.39 (10.23-10.56) for pre-frail, mildly, moderately, and severely frail, respectively, to 1.51 (1.49-1.53), 2.36 (2.33-2.39), 3.68 (3.63-3.73), 6.62 (6.53-6.71) in 2012. At every frailty level, risk of mortality was lower for women versus men and higher for blacks versus whites. CONCLUSIONS: Frailty affects at least 3 of every 10 U.S. Veterans aged 65 years and older, and is strongly associated with mortality. The VA-FI could be used to more accurately estimate life expectancy and individualize care for Veterans.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: "Rediscovered" in 1976, transhiatal esophagectomy (THE) has been applicable in most situations requiring esophageal resection and reconstruction. The objective of this study was to review the authors' 30-year experience with THE and changing trends in its use. METHODS: Using the authors' prospective Esophagectomy Database, this single institution experience with THE was analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Two thousand and seven THEs were performed-1063 (previously reported) between 1976 and 1998 (group I) and 944 from 1998 to 2006 (group II), 24\% for benign disease, 76\%, cancer. THE was possible in 98\%. Stomach was the esophageal substitute in 97\%. Comparing outcomes between group I and group II, statistically significant differences (P {$<$} 0.001) were observed in hospital mortality (4\% vs. 1\%); adenocarcinoma histology (69\% vs. 86\%); use of neoadjuvant chemoradiation (28\% vs. 52\%); mean blood loss (677 vs. 368 mL); anastomotic leak (14\% vs. 9\%); and discharge within 10 days (52\% vs. 78\%). Major complications remain infrequent: wound infection/dehiscence, 3\%, atelectasis/pneumonia, 2\%, intrathoracic hemorrhage, recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis, chylothorax, and tracheal laceration, {$<$}1\% each. Late functional results have been good or excellent in 73\%. Aggressive preoperative conditioning, avoiding the ICU, improved pain management, and early ambulation reduce length of stay, with 50\% in group II discharged within 1 week. CONCLUSION: THE refinements have reduced the historic morbidity and mortality of esophageal resection. This largest reported THE experience reinforces the value of consistent technique and a clinical pathway in managing these high acuity esophageal patients.},

Continuity of the alimentary tract was restored by anastomosing the pharynx or cervical esophagus either to stomach (19 patients) or to a colonic graft (seven patients). Esophageal resection and reconstruction were performed in a single stage in 25 patients, and the esophageal substitute was positioned in the posterior mediastinum in the original esophageal bed in 24 patients. There were no deaths directly related to the technique of blunt esophagectomy. Average intraoperative blood loss was 1,350 ml. for the entire group, 1,650 ml. for those requiring concomitant laryngectomy and 1,050 ml. for those undergoing esophagectomy without laryngectomy. Complications in these patients included pneumothorax (eight), transient hoarseness (five), pleural effusion (five), anastomotic leak (four), subphrenic abscess (one), and cerebrovascular accident (one). The five deaths were due to pheumonia (two), innominate artery rupture (two), and pulmonary embolus (one). Blunt esophagectomy without thoracotomy is safe and is far better tolerated physiologically than the combined transthoracic and abdominal operations more traditionally used for exophageal resection and reconstruction.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Malnutrition is common after oesophageal cancer surgery. This study aims to investigate body mass index (BMI) kinetics and the risk factors of malnutrition among 1-year disease-free survivors after radical transthoracic oesophagectomy for cancer. METHODS: From a prospective single-institution database, 118 1-year disease-free survivors having undergone a R0 transthoracic oesophagectomy with gastric tubulization between 2000 and 2008 were identified retrospectively. BMI values were collected at the onset of the disease (pre-treatment BMI), at the time of surgery (preoperative BMI), at postoperative 6 months and 1 year after oesophagectomy (1-year BMI). Logistic regression was performed with adjustment for confounders to estimate odds ratios of the factors associated with a 1-year weight loss (WL) of at least 15\% of the pre-treatment body weight (BW). RESULTS: At the onset of the disease, 5 patients (4\%) were underweighted (BMI {$<$} 8.5 kg/m\&sup2;), 65 (55\%) were normal (BMI = 18.5-24.9 kg/m\&sup2;), 36 (31\%) were overweighted (BMI {$>$} 25 kg/m\&sup2;) and 12 (10\%) were obese (BMI {$>$} 30 kg/m\&sup2;). Mean pre-treatment, preoperative, postoperative 6-month and 1-year BMI values were 24.64 {$\pm$} 4 kg/m\&sup2;, 23.55 {$\pm$} 3.8 kg/m\&sup2;, 21.7 {$\pm$} 3 kg/m\&sup2; and 21.97 {$\pm$} 4 kg/m\&sup2;, respectively. One-year WL {$\geq$} 15\% of the pre-treatment BW was present in 29 patients (25\%): 18 among the 48 patients (37\%) with a pre-treatment BMI {$\geq$} 25 and 11 among the 70 patients (15\%) with pre-treatment BMI {$<$} 25 (P = 0.006). On logistic regression, initial overweighting was the sole independent prognosticator of 1-year postoperative WL of at least 15\% of the pre-treatment BW (P = 0.039; OR: 2.96, [1.06-8.32]). CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative malnutrition remains a severe problem after oesophageal cancer resection, even in long-term disease-free survivors. Overweight and obese patients are the segment population most exposed to this postoperative malnutrition, suggesting that such surgery could have substantial bariatric effect. A special vigilance programme on the nutritional status of this sub-group of patients should be the rule.},

This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of sarcopenia on long-term outcome after esophageal resection following neoadjuvant treatment. METHODS: Skeletal muscle index (SMI) and body composition parameters were measured in patients receiving neoadjuvant treatment for locally advanced esophageal cancer. Endpoints included relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: The study included 130 patients. Sarcopenia was found in 80 patients (61.5\%). Patients with squamous-cell cancer (SCC) showed a decreased median SMI of 48 (range 28.4-60.8) cm/m2 compared with that of patients with adenocarcinoma (AC) of 52 (range 34.4-74.2) cm/m2, P~{$<~$}0.001. The presence of sarcopenia had a significant impact on patient outcome: HR 1.69 (1.04-2.75), P~=~0.036. Median OS was 20.5 (7.36-33.64) versus 52.1 (13.55-90.65) months in sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic patients, respectively. Sarcopenia was identified as an independent risk factor: HR 1.72 (1.049-2.83), P~=~0.032. CONCLUSION: Our data provide evidence that sarcopenia impacts long-term outcome after esophageal resection in patients who have undergone neoadjuvant therapy. Assessment of the body composition parameter can be a reasonable part of patient selection and may influence treatment methods.},

However, there have been limited applications of EHR-based approaches in the United States. METHODS: We constructed an adapted eFI for patients in our Medicare Accountable Care Organization (ACO, N = 12,798) using encounter, diagnosis code, laboratory, medication, and Medicare Annual Wellness Visit (AWV) data from the EHR. We examined the association of the eFI with mortality, health care utilization, and injurious falls. RESULTS: The overall cohort was 55.7\% female, 85.7\% white, with a mean age of 74.9 (SD = 7.3) years. In the prior 2 years, 32.1\% had AWV data. The eFI could be calculated for 9,013 (70.4\%) ACO patients. Of these, 46.5\% were classified as prefrail (0.10 {$<$} eFI {$\leq$} 0.21) and 40.1\% frail (eFI {$>$} 0.21). Accounting for age, comorbidity, and prior health care utilization, the eFI independently predicted all-cause mortality, inpatient hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and injurious falls (all p {$<$} .001). Having at least one functional deficit captured from the AWV was independently associated with an increased risk of hospitalizations and injurious falls, controlling for other components of the eFI. CONCLUSIONS: Construction of an eFI from the EHR, within the context of a managed care population, is feasible and can help to identify vulnerable older adults. Future work is needed to integrate the eFI with claims-based approaches and test whether it can be used to effectively target interventions tailored to the health needs of frail patients.},

Methods: all consecutive older outpatients with cancer were included in a prospective two-centre cohort study between 2013 and 2017 and had geriatric assessment. We used the frailty phenotype. Sarcopenia and cachexia were built as latent variables by including observed variables related to physical performances and related to nutrition and inflammation respectively. Structural equation modelling was used to distinguish between direct and indirect effects of the frailty parameters on the risk of death (Model 1) and the risk of morbidity (defined by unplanned hospitalization and/or disability and/or a fall; Model 2). The root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) and the comparative fit index (CFI) were used to assess the model fit. Results: 603 older outpatients were included (mean age: 81.2 {$\pm$} 6.1; women: 54\%; frailty phenotype: 58\%). The 6-month mortality and morbidity rates were 18\% and 64\%, respectively. The fit was good for both models (RMSEA and CFI = 0.029 [0.017\textendash 0.039] and 0.99 for Model 1, and 0.028 [0.017\textendash 0.039] and 0.99 for Model 2, respectively).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a secondary analysis of data collected from the state cancer registry maintained by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. We identified patients with an esophageal cancer diagnosis between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2013. {$\chi$}2 test and logistics regression were used to analyze 6,809 patients who met our eligibility criteria. Statistical significance was defined as P {$\leq$} .05. RESULTS: Approximately 88.4\% of our patients were White and 11.6\% were Black. A significantly higher number of White patients were married when compared with Blacks (62.9\% v 31.8\%, respectively; P {$<$} .0001). There was no significant difference in cancer staging between the 2 groups (P = .0671). Married Blacks had similar rates of esophagectomy, chemotherapy, and radiation as married Whites. Both single groups had lower rates of esophagectomy and chemotherapy than married Whites, but single Blacks were the least likely to undergo esophagectomy. Single patients were more likely to refuse treatment. CONCLUSION: Marital status differs significantly in Black and White patients with esophageal cancer and may help explain racial disparities in cancer care. Further research is needed to explore reasons for care underutilization in single patients and whether these differences translate into clinical outcomes.},

This study investigated changes in body weight and risk factors for weight loss after esophagectomy for esophageal cancer. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed records of 181 patients who underwent esophagectomy and gastric pull-up from 2012 to June 2016. Patients with operative mortality and recurrences were excluded. Percent change in body weight was defined as change in body weight (\%)\,=\,(1-year body weight\,-\,preoperative body weight)\,\texttimes\,100/preoperative body weight. RESULTS: Mean age of patients was 62.98\,{$\pm$}\,8.23~years with 164 men (90.6\%). Mean preoperative body weight was 63.12\,{$\pm$}\,9.42~kg, and body weight at 1~year was 56.04\,{$\pm$}\,8.59~kg. Mean change in body weight was -\,10.95\,{$\pm$}\,7.50\%, and 98 (54.1\%) patients showed weight loss more than 10\% compared to initial body weight. Univariable analysis showed that initial body weight, narrow gastric tube, thoracotomy, laparotomy, and postoperative vocal cord palsy (VCP) were related to more than 10\% weight loss. Multivariable analysis showed that initial body weight (odds ratio [OR]\,=\,1.041, p\,=\,0.031) and postoperative VCP (OR\,=\,2.772, p\,=\,0.025) were adverse risk factors for weight loss 1~year after esophagectomy, whereas conduit type, route of reconstruction, postoperative complications, anastomotic complications, minimally invasive esophagectomy, and adjuvant therapy were not. CONCLUSIONS: Initial body weight and postoperative VCP were related to weight loss. Patients with VCP need additional nutritional monitoring and support.},

We investigated skeletal muscle mass change during palliative chemotherapy for advanced gastric cancer (AGC) and its association with treatment outcomes. We retrospectively reviewed 111 consecutive AGC patients who underwent first-line palliative chemotherapy. Skeletal muscle area was measured before and after chemotherapy at the third lumbar vertebra level using computed tomography scans. We compared skeletal muscle index (SMI), body mass index (BMI), and body weight changes to chemotherapy response and survival. The 80 male and 31 female patients' median age was 65 (range 31-87) years, and 46.8\% had sarcopenia at baseline. Median pre-chemotherapy to post-chemotherapy SMI, BMI, and body weight decreases were -\,4.5~cm2/m2 (-\,11.3\%) (P\,{$<$}\,0.001); -\,0.7~kg/m2 (-\,3.2\%) (P\,{$<$}\,0.001); and -\,2.0~kg (-\,3.5\%) (P\,{$<$}\,0.001), respectively. Median SMI decreases for patients with objective response, stable disease, and disease progression were -\,4.0 cm2/m2 (range -\,20.1\,\textasciitilde\,9.5); -\,4.5 cm2/m2 (range -\,19.8\,\textasciitilde\,0.8); and -\,3.8 cm2/m2 (range: -\,17.6\,\textasciitilde\,0.1), respectively.

In multivariable analysis, sarcopenia at baseline (HR 1.681; 95\% CI 1.083-2.609, P\,=\,0.021), decreased SMI (HR 1.620; 95\% CI 1.041-2.520; P\,=\,0.032) were significant poor prognostic factors for survival. Skeletal muscle mass decreased significantly during chemotherapy in AGC patients, but was not associated with chemotherapy response. Decreased SMI was a poor prognostic factor in AGC patients during first-line palliative chemotherapy.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This network meta-analysis compared overall survival after neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy (CT), radiotherapy (RT), or combinations of both (chemoradiotherapy, CRT) or surgery alone to identify the most effective approach. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The optimal treatment for resectable esophageal cancer is unknown. METHODS: A search for randomized controlled trials reporting on neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapies was conducted. Using a network meta-analysis, treatments were ranked based on their effectiveness for improving survival. RESULTS: In 33 eligible randomized controlled trials, 6072 patients were randomized to receive either surgery alone (N = 2459) or neoadjuvant CT (N = 1332), RT (N = 58), and CRT (N = 1196) followed by surgery or surgery followed by adjuvant CT (N = 542), RT (N = 383), and CRT (N = 102). Twenty-one comparisons were generated. Neoadjuvant CRT followed by surgery compared with surgery alone was the only treatment to significantly improve survival [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.77, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.68-0.87]. When trials were grouped considering neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapies and surgery alone, neoadjuvant therapies combined with surgery compared with surgery alone showed a survival advantage (HR = 0.83, 95\% CI 0.76-0.90), whereas surgery along with adjuvant therapies showed no significant survival advantage (HR = 0.87, 95\% CI 0.67-1.14). A subgroup analysis of neoadjuvant therapies showed a superior effectiveness of neoadjuvant CRT and surgery compared with surgery alone (HR = 0.77, 95\% CI 0.68-0.87). CONCLUSIONS: This network meta-analysis showed neoadjuvant CRT followed by surgery to be the most effective strategy in improving survival of resectable esophageal cancer. Resources should be focused on developing the most effective neoadjuvant CRT regimens for both adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas of the esophagus.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Our institution's experience with low anterior resection in combination with coloanal anastomosis (LAR/CAA) for primary rectal cancer was reviewed (1) to determine cancer treatment results, 2) to identify risk factors for pelvic recurrence, and 3) to assess the long-term success of sphincter preservation. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Use of sphincter-preserving resection for mid-rectal and selected distal-rectal cancers continues to increase. As surgical techniques and adjuvant therapy evolve, treatment results must be carefully assessed. METHODS: One hundred thirty-four patients treated for primary rectal cancer by LAR/CAA between 1977 and 1990 were studied retrospectively. All pathologic slides were reviewed. Median follow-up was 4 years. RESULTS: Actuarial 5-year survival for all patients was 73\%. Among 36 patients who relapsed, distant metastatic disease had developed at the time of first clinical relapse in most (86\%). Pelvic recurrence was detected in 13 patients, an actuarial rate of 11\% at 5 years. Mesenteric implants, positive microscopic resection margin, T3 tumor, perineural invasion, blood vessel invasion, and high tumor grade were associated with increased risk for pelvic recurrence. Eleven patients ultimately required permanent colostomy, and in eight instances the cause was pelvic recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Low anterior resection combined with coloanal anastomosis provides good treatment for mid-rectal cancers and for some distal rectal cancers. Pelvic recurrence is not associated with short distal resection margins but is correlated with the presence of histopathologic markers of aggressive disease in the primary tumor. Long-term preservation of anal sphincter function depends primarily on control of pelvic tumor and can be achieved in more than 90\% of patients.},

This report provides 5 year follow-up data from a large prospective study investigating the efficacy and safety of endoscopic treatment in these patients and analysing risk factors for recurrence. DESIGN: Prospective case series. SETTING: Academic tertiary care centre. PATIENTS: Between October 1996 and September 2002, 61 patients with HGIN and 288 with BC were included (173 with short-segment and 176 with long-segment Barrett's oesophagus) from a total of 486 patients presenting with Barrett's neoplasia. Patients with submucosal or more advanced cancer were excluded. INTERVENTIONS: Endoscopic therapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rate of complete remission and recurrence rate, tumour-associated death. RESULTS: Endoscopic resection was performed in 279 patients, photodynamic therapy in 55, and both procedures in 13; two patients received argon plasma coagulation. The mean follow-up period was 63.6 (SD 23.1) months. Complete response (CR) was achieved in 337 patients (96.6\%); surgery was necessary in 13 (3.7\%) after endoscopic therapy failed. Metachronous lesions developed during the follow-up in 74 patients (21.5\%); 56 died of concomitant disease, but none died of BC. The calculated 5 year survival rate was 84\%. The risk factors most frequently associated with recurrence were piecemeal resection, long-segment Barrett's oesophagus, no ablative therapy of Barrett's oesophagus after CR, time until CR achieved {$>$}10 months and multifocal neoplasia. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that endoscopic therapy was highly effective and safe, with an excellent long-term survival rate. The risk factors identified may help stratify patients who are at risk for recurrence and those requiring more intensified follow-up.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Barrett's esophagus-associated high-grade dysplasia is commonly treated by endoscopy. However, most guidelines offer no recommendations for endoscopic treatment of mucosal adenocarcinoma of the esophagus (mAC). We investigated the efficacy and safety of endoscopic resection in a large series of patients with mAC. METHODS: We collected data from 1000 consecutive patients (mean age, 69.1 {$\pm$} 10.7 years; 861 men) with mAC (481 with short-segment and 519 with long-segment Barrett's esophagus) who presented at a tertiary care center from October 1996 to September 2010. Patients with low-grade and high-grade dysplasia and submucosal or more advanced cancer were excluded. All patients underwent endoscopic resection of mACs. Patients found to have submucosal cancer at their first endoscopy examination were excluded from the analysis. RESULTS: After a mean follow-up period of 56.6 {$\pm$} 33.4 months, 963 patients (96.3\%) had achieved a complete response; surgery was necessary in 12 patients (3.7\%) after endoscopic therapy failed. Metachronous lesions or recurrence of cancer developed during the follow-up period in 140 patients (14.5\%) but endoscopic re-treatment was successful in 115, resulting in a long-term complete remission rate of 93.8\%; 111 died of concomitant disease and 2 of Barrett's esophagus-associated cancer. The calculated 10-year survival rate of patients who underwent endoscopic resection of mACs was 75\%. Major complications developed in 15 patients (1.5\%) but could be managed conservatively. CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic therapy is highly effective and safe for patients with mAC, with excellent long-term results. In an almost 5-year follow-up of 1000 patients treated with endoscopic resection, there was no mortality and less than 2\% had major complications. Endoscopic therapy should become the standard of care for patients with mAC.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A short course of radiotherapy is commonly prescribed for palliative relief of malignant dysphagia in patients with incurable oesophageal cancer. We compared chemoradiotherapy with radiotherapy alone for dysphagia relief in the palliative setting. METHODS: This multicentre randomised controlled trial included patients with advanced or metastatic oesophageal cancer who were randomly assigned (1:1) through a computer-generated adaptive biased coin design to either palliative chemoradiotherapy or radiotherapy alone for treatment of malignant dysphagia at 22 hospitals in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the UK. Eligible patients had biopsy-proven oesophageal cancer that was unsuitable for curative treatment, symptomatic dysphagia, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-2, and adequate haematological and renal function. Patients were stratified by hospital, dysphagia score (Mellow scale 1-4), and presence of metastases. The radiotherapy dose was 35 Gy in 15 fractions over 3 weeks for patients in Australia and New Zealand and 30 Gy in ten fractions over 2 weeks for patients in Canada and the UK. Chemotherapy consisted of one cycle of intravenous cisplatin (either 80 mg/m2 on day 1 or 20 mg/m2 per day on days 1-4 of radiotherapy at clinician's discretion) and intravenous fluorouracil 800 mg/m2 per day on days 1-4 of radiotherapy in week 1. Patients were assessed weekly during treatment. The primary endpoint was dysphagia relief (defined as {$\geq$}1 point reduction on the Mellow scale at 9 weeks and maintained 4 weeks later), and key secondary endpoints were dysphagia progression-free survival (defined as a worsening of at least 1 point on the Mellow scale from baseline or best response) and overall survival. These endpoints were analysed in the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00193882. This trial is closed. FINDINGS: Between July 7, 2003, and March 21, 2012, 111 patients were randomly assigned to chemoradiotherapy and 109 patients to radiotherapy. One patient in the chemoradiotherapy group was omitted from analysis because of ineligibility. 50 (45\%, 95\% CI 36-55) patients in the chemoradiotherapy group and 38 (35\%, 26-44) in the radiotherapy group obtained dysphagia relief (difference 10{$\cdot$}6\%, 95\% CI -2 to 23; p=0{$\cdot$}13). Median dysphagia progression-free survival was 4{$\cdot$}1 months (95\% CI 3{$\cdot$}5-4{$\cdot$}8) versus 3{$\cdot$}4 months (3{$\cdot$}1-4{$\cdot$}3) in the chemoradiotherapy and radiotherapy groups, respectively (p=0{$\cdot$}58), and median overall survival was 6{$\cdot$}9 months (95\% CI 5{$\cdot$}1-8{$\cdot$}3) versus 6{$\cdot$}7 months (4{$\cdot$}9-8{$\cdot$}0), respectively (p=0{$\cdot$}88). Of the 211 patients who commenced radiotherapy, grade 3-4 acute toxicity occurred in 38 (36\%) patients in the chemoradiotherapy group and in 17 (16\%) patients in the radiotherapy group (p=0{$\cdot$}0017). Anaemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, oesophagitis, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting, and mucositis were significantly worse in patients who had chemoradiotherapy than in patients who had radiotherapy. INTERPRETATION: Palliative chemoradiotherapy showed a modest, but not statistically significant, increase in dysphagia relief compared with radiotherapy alone, with minimal improvement in dysphagia progression-free survival and overall survival with chemoradiotherapy but at a cost of increased toxicity. A short course of radiotherapy alone should be considered a safe and well tolerated treatment for malignant dysphagia in the palliative setting.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The progressive loss of skeletal muscle and function (known as sarcopenia) has been shown to be associated with various adverse outcome measures. Sophisticated measurements of body composition are increasingly being incorporated into research studies to stratify patients into those with or without sarcopenia, monitor treatment effects, and predict complications. A typical approach is to select axial image(s) at the mid-lumbar level and use semi-automated software to identify and quantify the skeletal muscle area. This area is then used to estimate whole-body parameters. This approach is somewhat subjective, and in this study we investigate its reproducibility, both within and between observers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Repeated muscle measurements were performed on a cohort of 29 patients by 3 radiologists, to examine their intra- and interobserver reproducibility. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Mean muscle area for the cohort was 156\,cm2, with a wide range (98 - 261\,cm2). There was good intraobserver agreement between measurements, with a mean absolute difference between repeated measurements on the same patient of 0.98\,cm2, and a measurement variability of 2.92\,cm2. Much of the variability was shown to be due to the choice of a different slice when performing the repeated measurement. Averaging two slices provided a small but non-significant improvement in comparison to the single slice approach. Interobserver results showed good agreement, though there was a small bias for one observer, who measured slightly larger volumes compared to the other two. We conclude that the approach described provides reproducible skeletal muscle area measurements, and offer three specific recommendations to minimise variability.},

METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials by comparing parenteral or oral iron and no iron, when added to ESAs in anemic cancer patients, in order to calculate the relative risk (RR) of hematopoietic response and transfusions, the time required to reach this response, and toxicity. RESULTS: A total of 1,606 patients out of eight trials were available for meta-analysis. The RR of obtaining an hematopoietic response was 1.29 (P = 0.0001) with parenteral iron and 1.04 for oral iron (P = 0.59). The risk of transfusion was reduced with parenteral iron versus no iron (RR 0.77; P = 0.02) but not with oral iron (RR 0.68; P = 0.08). The time to reach hematopoietic response was 1 month shorter and no increased toxicity appeared with iron supplementation. CONCLUSION: Overall parenteral iron reduces the risk of transfusions by 23\% and increases the chance of hematopoietic response by 29\% when compared with ESAs alone. On the contrary, oral iron does not increase hematopoietic response nor transfusion rate. The significance of these results is that the proportion of non-responders to ESAs will have strongly improved and quality of life and cost ameliorated.},

  abstract = {Background Adults with impaired performance status (PS) often receive immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) for advanced non\textendash small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) despite limited efficacy data and unknown effects on end-of-life care. Methods This was a retrospective, single-site study of 237 patients with advanced NSCLC who initiated ICI treatment from 2015 to 2017. Cox regression was used to compare the overall survival (OS) of patients who had impaired PS ({$\geq$}2) at the start of ICI treatment with those who had PS 0 or 1 using Cox regression. Logistic regression was conducted to analyze the association between ICI use in the last 30 days of life and the use of end-of-life health care. Results The patient mean age at ICI initiation was 67 years (range, 37-91 years), and 35.4\% of patients had PS {$\geq$}2. Most patients (80.8\%) received ICI as second-line or later therapy. The median OS was 4.5 months in patients with PS {$\geq$}2 and 14.3 months in those with PS 0 or 1 (hazard ratio, 2.5; P {$<$} .0001). Among the patients who died (n = 184), 28.8\% who had PS {$\geq$}2 received ICIs in their last 30 days of life compared with 10.8\% of those who had PS 0 or 1 (P = .002). Receipt of ICI in the last 30 days of life was associated with decreased hospice referral (odds ratio, 0.29; P = .008) and increased in-hospital deaths (odds ratio, 6.8; P = .001), independent of PS. Conclusions Adults with advanced NSCLC and impaired PS experience significantly shorter survival after ICI treatment and receive ICIs near death more often than those with better PS. Receipt of an ICI near death was associated with lower hospice use and an increased risk of death in the hospital. These results underscore the need for high-quality communication about potential tradeoffs of ICIs, particularly among adults receiving ICIs as second-line or later therapy.},

This preplanned interim analysis examined the pathological outcome of delaying surgery. METHODS: Patients randomized to the SRT and SRT-delay arms in the Stockholm III Trial between October 1998 and November 2010 were included, and data were collected in a prospective register. Additional data regarding tumour regression grade, according to Dworak, and circumferential margin were obtained by reassessment of histopathological slides. RESULTS: A total of 462 of 545 randomized patients had specimens available for reassessment. Patients randomized to SRT-delay had earlier ypT categories, and a higher rate of pathological complete responses (11{$\cdot$}8 versus 1{$\cdot$}7 per cent; P\,=\,0{$\cdot$}001) and Dworak grade 4 tumour regression (10{$\cdot$}1 versus 1{$\cdot$}7 per cent; P\,{$<$}\,0{$\cdot$}001) than patients randomized to SRT without delay. Positive circumferential resection margins were uncommon (6{$\cdot$}3 per cent) and rates did not differ between the two treatment arms. CONCLUSION: Short-course RT induces tumour downstaging if surgery is performed after an interval of 4-8 weeks.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Barrett esophagus containing low-grade dysplasia is associated with an increased risk of developing esophageal adenocarcinoma, a cancer with a rapidly increasing incidence in the western world. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether endoscopic radiofrequency ablation could decrease the rate of neoplastic progression. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Multicenter randomized clinical trial that enrolled 136 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Barrett esophagus containing low-grade dysplasia at 9 European sites between June 2007 and June 2011. Patient follow-up ended May 2013. INTERVENTIONS: Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either endoscopic treatment with radiofrequency ablation (ablation) or endoscopic surveillance (control). Ablation was performed with the balloon device for circumferential ablation of the esophagus or the focal device for targeted ablation, with a maximum of 5 sessions allowed. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was neoplastic progression to high-grade dysplasia or adenocarcinoma during a 3-year follow-up since randomization. Secondary outcomes were complete eradication of dysplasia and intestinal metaplasia and adverse events. RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients were randomized to receive ablation and 68 to receive control. Ablation reduced the risk of progression to high-grade dysplasia or adenocarcinoma by 25.0\% (1.5\% for ablation vs 26.5\% for control; 95\% CI, 14.1\%-35.9\%; P\,{$<$}\,.001) and the risk of progression to adenocarcinoma by 7.4\% (1.5\% for ablation vs 8.8\% for control; 95\% CI, 0\%-14.7\%; P\,=\,.03). Among patients in the ablation group, complete eradication occurred in 92.6\% for dysplasia and 88.2\% for intestinal metaplasia compared with 27.9\% for dysplasia and 0.0\% for intestinal metaplasia among patients in the control group (P\,{$<$}\,.001). Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 19.1\% of patients receiving ablation (P\,{$<$}\,.001). The most common adverse event was stricture, occurring in 8 patients receiving ablation (11.8\%), all resolved by endoscopic dilation (median, 1 session). The data and safety monitoring board recommended early termination of the trial due to superiority of ablation for the primary outcome and the potential for patient safety issues if the trial continued. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized trial of patients with Barrett esophagus and a confirmed diagnosis of low-grade dysplasia, radiofrequency ablation resulted in a reduced risk of neoplastic progression over 3 years of follow-up.

These multi-modal protocols have been also introduced to oesophageal cancer surgery. This review aimed to evaluate current literature on ERAS in oesophageal cancer surgery and conduct a meta-analysis on primary and secondary outcomes. METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus and Cochrane Library were searched for eligible studies. We analyzed data up to May 2016. Eligible studies had to contain four described ERAS protocol elements. The primary outcome was overall morbidity. Secondary outcomes included length of hospital stay, specific complications, mortality and readmissions. Random effect meta-analyses were undertaken. RESULTS: Initial search yielded 1,064 articles. Thorough evaluation resulted in 13 eligible articles which were analyzed. A total of 2,042 patients were included in the analysis (1,058 ERAS group and 984 treated with traditional protocols). Analysis of overall morbidity as well as complication rate did not show any significant reduction. Non-surgical complications and pulmonary complications were significantly lower in the ERAS group, RR = 0.71 95\% CI 0.62-0.80, p {$<$} 0.00001 and RR = 0.75, 95\% CI 0.60-0.94, p = 0.01, respectively.

The patient is observed and timed while he rises from an arm chair, walks 3 meters, turns, walks back, and sits down again. The results indicate that the time score is (1) reliable (inter-rater and intra-rater); (2) correlates well with log-transformed scores on the Berg Balance Scale (r = -0.81), gait speed (r = -0.61) and Barthel Index of ADL (r = -0.78); and (3) appears to predict the patient's ability to go outside alone safely. These data suggest that the timed "Up \& Go" test is a reliable and valid test for quantifying functional mobility that may also be useful in following clinical change over time. The test is quick, requires no special equipment or training, and is easily included as part of the routine medical examination.},

We developed a novel finite element method (FEM) deformable model that incorporates a priori shape information via a statistical deformation model (SDM) within the template-based segmentation framework. The proposed method was validated on 1000 abdominal and 530 thoracic CT images and we obtained very good segmentation results with Jaccard scores in excess of 90\% for both the muscle and fat regions.},

  abstract = {Metabolic reprogramming occurs in tumors to foster cancer cell proliferation, survival and metastasis, but as well at a systemic level affecting the whole organism, eventually leading to cancer cachexia. Indeed, as cancer cells rely on external sources of nitrogen and carbon skeleton to grow, systemic metabolic deregulation promoting tissue wasting and metabolites mobilization ultimately supports tumor growth. Cachectic patients experience a wide range of symptoms affecting several organ functions such as muscle, liver, brain, immune system and heart, collectively decreasing patients' quality of life and worsening their prognosis. Moreover, cachexia is estimated to be the direct cause of at least 20\% of cancer deaths. The main aspect of cachexia syndrome is the unstoppable skeletal muscle and fat storage wasting, even with an adequate caloric intake, resulting in nutrient mobilization - both directly as lipid and amino acids and indirectly as glucose derived from the exploitation of liver gluconeogenesis - that reaches the tumor through the bloodstream. From a metabolic standpoint, cachectic host develops a wide range of dysfunctions, from increased insulin and IGF-1 resistance to induction of mitochondrial uncoupling proteins and fat tissue browning resulting in an increased energy expenditure and heat generation, even at rest. For a long time, cachexia has been merely considered an epiphenomenon of end-stage tumors. However, in specific tumor types, such as pancreatic cancers, it is now clear that patients present markers of tissue wasting at a stage in which tumor is not yet clinically detectable, and that host amino acid supply is required for tumor growth. Indeed, tumor cells actively promote tissue wasting by secreting specific factors such as parathyroid hormone-related protein and micro RNAs. Understanding the molecular and metabolic mediators of cachexia will not only advance therapeutic approaches against cancer, but also improve patients' quality of life.},

Prophylactic surgery has been traditionally considered in this setting in order to prevent subsequent complications of perforation, obstruction, or bleeding later during the treatment course, which may require urgent surgery associated with higher mortality. However, recent data have called into question the efficacy of this upfront surgical strategy. We provide a brief overview of how current combinations of systemic chemotherapy including fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, irinotecan, and targeted biologic agents have allowed improved local (in addition to distant) tumor control, significantly decreasing the incidence of late primary-related complications requiring surgery from roughly 20\% in the era of single-agent fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy to almost 7\% in the era of modern triple-drug chemotherapy. In addition, we attempt to highlight those factors most associated with subsequent primary tumor-related complications in an effort to identify the subset of patients with synchronous metastatic colorectal cancer who might benefit from a surgery-first approach. Finally, we discuss modern nonsurgical options available for palliation of the primary colorectal tumor and review the outcome of patients for which emergent surgery is eventually required to address primary-related symptoms.},

OBJECTIVE: We investigated the clinical course of skeletal muscle wasting in advanced cancer and the window of possible muscle anabolism. DESIGN: We conducted a quantitative analysis of computed tomography (CT) images for the loss and gain of muscle in population-based cohorts of advanced cancer patients (lung, colorectal, and pancreas cancer and cholangiocarcinoma) in a longitudinal observational study. RESULTS: Advanced-cancer patients (n = 368; median survival: 196 d) had a total of 1279 CT images over the course of their disease. With consideration of all time points, muscle loss occurred in 39\% of intervals between any 2 scans. However, the overall frequency of muscle gain was 15.4\%, and muscle was stable in 45.6\% of intervals between any 2 scans, which made the maintenance or gain of muscle the predominant behavior. Multinomial logistic regression revealed that being within 90 d (compared with {$>$}90 d) from death was the principal risk factor for muscle loss (OR: 2.67; 95\% CI: 1.45, 4.94; P = 0.002), and muscle gain was correspondingly less likely (OR: 0.37; 95\% CI: 0.20, 0.69; P = 0.002) at this time. Sex, age, BMI, and tumor group were not significant predictors of muscle loss or gain. CONCLUSIONS: A window of anabolic potential exists at defined early phases of the disease trajectory ({$>$}90 d survival), creating an opportunity for nutritional intervention to stop or reverse cachexia. Cancer patients within 90 d of death have a low likelihood of anabolic potential.},

RECENT FINDINGS: One of the characteristics of cancer cachexia is the depletion of muscle with or without adipose tissue loss. Therefore, a body composition tool that specifically distinguishes between these tissues is essential in assessing this syndrome. Cancer patients are routinely evaluated by high resolution imaging such as CT for the purpose of diagnosis and follow-up. Recent work exploiting CT images for body composition analysis has revealed the natural history of cancer cachexia, including progressive alterations in skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, organs, and tumor mass. CT-based quantification of skeletal muscle has permitted identification of individuals with sarcopenia, and links between sarcopenia and functional status, chemotherapy toxicity, time to tumor progression, and mortality. SUMMARY: CT images routinely acquired from health records of cancer patients can be used to quantify specific lean and adipose tissues, to interpret body composition in population-based studies, and to evaluate individual patients in a clinical and therapeutic decision-making setting.},

Data from a prospective study were used to determine if the highest doses of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) per kilogram LBM would be associated with dose-limiting toxicity in stage II/III colon cancer patients treated with 5-FU and leucovorin. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Toxicity after cycle 1 was graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria, version 2.0. Muscle tissue was measured by computerized tomography. An extrapolation to the LBM compartment of the whole body was employed. RESULTS: Mean values of 5-FU/LBM of the entire population were different in terms of presence or absence of toxicity (P = 0.036). A cut point of 20 mg 5-FU/kg LBM seemed to be a threshold for developing toxicity (P = 0.005). This observation was pertinent to women (odds ratio, 16.73; P = 0.021). Women in this study had a relatively low proportion of LBM relative to their body surface area. CONCLUSION: Our study shows that low LBM is a significant predictor of toxicity in female patients administered 5-FU using the convention of dosing per unit of body surface area. We conclude that variation in toxicity between females and males may be partially explained by this feature of body composition.},

Available lumbar CT images of the obese patients were analysed for total skeletal muscle cross-sectional area; these values were also used to estimate total body fat-free mass (FFM). FINDINGS: Of the 2115 patients initially identified, 325 (15\%) were classified as obese (body-mass index [BMI] {$>$} or =30). Of these obese patients, 250 had CT images that met the criteria for analysis. The remaining 75 patients were recorded as without assessable scans. Obese patients had a wide range of muscle mass. Sex-specific cut-offs that defined a significant association between low muscle mass with mortality were ascertained by optimum stratification analysis: 38 (15\%) of 250 patients who had assessable CT images that met the criteria for analysis were below these cut-offs and were classified as having sarcopenia. Sarcopenic obesity was associated with poorer functional status compared with obese patients who did not have sarcopenia (p=0.009), and was an independent predictor of survival (hazard ratio [HR] 4.2 [95\% CI 2.4-7.2], p{$<$}0.0001). Estimated FFM showed a poor association with body-surface area (r(2)=0.37). Assuming that FFM represents the volume of distribution of many cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs, we estimated that individual variation in FFM could account for up to three-times variation in effective volume of distribution for chemotherapy administered per unit body-surface area, in this population. INTERPRETATION: This study provides evidence of the great variability of body composition in patients with cancer and links body composition, especially sarcopenic obesity, to clinical implications such as functional status, survival, and potentially, chemotherapy toxicity.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most non-oncologic clinical practice guidelines recommend restrictive allogeneic blood transfusion practices; however, there is a lack of consensus regarding the best transfusion practice in oncology. We conducted a systematic review of the literature to compare the efficacy and safety of restrictive versus liberal transfusion strategies in patients with cancer. METHODS: A literature search using MEDLINE, PUBMED and EMBASE identified all controlled studies comparing the use of restrictive with liberal transfusion in adult oncology participants up to August 10, 2015. Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data and appraised the quality of the included studies. The primary outcomes of interest were blood utilization and all-cause mortality. RESULTS: Out of 4241 citations, six studies (3 randomized and 3 non-randomized) involving a total of 983 patients were included in the final review. The clinical context of the studies varied with 3 chemotherapy and 3 surgical studies. The overall risk of bias in all studies was moderate to high. Restrictive transfusion strategies were associated with a 36\% reduced risk of receiving a perioperative transfusion (risk ratio (RR) 0.64, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.49-0.83). There was no difference in mortality between the strategies (RR 1.00, 95\% CI 0.32-3.18). There were no differences in adverse events reported between the restrictive and liberal transfusion strategies. CONCLUSION: Restrictive strategy appears to decrease blood utilization without increasing morbidity or mortality in oncology. This review is limited by a paucity of high quality studies on this topic. Better designed studies are warranted.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the immediate influence of chest tube removal on chest pain and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) after pulmonary resection. METHODS: Prospective longitudinal investigation on 104 consecutive patients (53 wedge/segmentectomies and 51 lobectomies; 69 muscle and nerve-sparing lateral thoracotomy and 35 video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS)). Post-operative chest pain was controlled in all patients by a standardized combination of oral and intravenous non-opioid analgesics. All patients had one chest tube (24 French). Static and dynamic (after forced expiratory effort) pain and FEV1 were assessed before and 1 h after the chest tube removal by the same operator. No additional analgesics were administered before or after the chest tube removal. The pain level was assessed by the numeric pain scale [range: 0 (no pain)-10 (excruciating pain)]. FEV1 was assessed by a portable spirometer. Bronchodilators were not used in these patients. Pre- and post-removal measurements were compared by the Wilcoxon signed rank test. RESULTS: The average pre-removal static and dynamic pain scores were 2.6 and 4.1, respectively. The static and dynamic pain scores decreased by 42 and 41\%, respectively, after the tube removal (P {$<$} 0.0001). The average FEV1 before the chest tube removal was 1.5 l or 53\% of the predicted value and increased by 13\% after the tube removal (P = 0.0004). In total, 56 and 78\% of patients reported static and dynamic pain scores improvement and 67\% showed an FEV1 improvement after the chest tube removal. Similar results were observed in patients operated on through VATS or thoracotomy. Compared with patients whose chest tube was removed later, those who had their chest tube removed before post operative day 3 (POD3), showed a greater reduction in the static pain score (41 vs. 31\%, P = 0.05) and greater improvement in FEV1 (18 vs. 0.01\%, P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: The removal of a chest tube reduces pain and improves ventilatory function, independent of surgical access and particularly in the early post-operative phase. A fast track chest tube removal policy may favour patients' recovery.},

OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of ESD for esophageal squamous cell neoplasia in a consecutive series of patients treated in a Western setting. DESIGN AND SETTING: Single-center, prospective observational study. PATIENTS AND INTERVENTION: From January 2005 to July 2008, 20 patients with superficial esophageal squamous cell neoplasia were treated by ESD. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Rates of en bloc resection, complete resection, and complications were evaluated as short-term outcomes. Overall survival, local or distant recurrence, and postoperative stricture rates were evaluated as long-term outcomes. RESULTS: ESD was performed in 20 patients (mean age 64 years, range 46-81 years; 16 men). The mean size of the lesion was 32 mm (range 15-60 mm); it was 30 mm or larger in 14 patients (70\%). The mean time of ESD was 89 minutes (range 58-180 minutes). En bloc resection with resection-free margins was achieved in 18 patients (90\%), whereas 2 patients presented with incomplete or indeterminate resection. Two cases (10\%) of mediastinal emphysema without overt perforation and 1 case (5\%) of post-ESD symptomatic stricture were reported. No local or distant post-ESD recurrence occurred in those with resection-free margins at a median follow-up of 18 months. LIMITATIONS: Small number of patients and limited follow-up. CONCLUSION: This Western series study confirms that ESD is a potentially curative treatment for superficial esophageal squamous cell neoplasia. Early and late complication rates were comparable to those of Japanese series. ESD should be probably considered as the treatment of choice in all large lesions amenable to endoscopic treatment.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anaemia affects 30-50\% of patients before they undergo major surgery. Preoperative anaemia is associated with increased need for blood transfusion, postoperative complications and worse patient outcomes after surgery. International guidelines support the use of intravenous iron to correct anaemia in patients before surgery. However, the use of preoperative intravenous iron for patient benefit has not been assessed in the setting of a formal clinical trial. OBJECTIVES: To assess if intravenous iron given to patients with anaemia before major abdominal surgery is beneficial by reducing transfusion rates, postoperative complications, hospital stay and re-admission to hospital, and improving quality of life outcomes. DESIGN: A multicentre, double-blinded, randomised, controlled, Phase III clinical trial, with 1 : 1 randomisation comparing placebo (normal saline) with intravenous iron (intravenous ferric carboxymaltose 1000\,mg). Randomisation and treatment allocation were by a secure web-based service. SETTING: The study was conducted across 46 hospitals in England, Scotland and Wales between September 2013 and September 2018. PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged {$>$}\,18 years, undergoing elective major open abdominal surgery, with anaemia [Hb level of {$>$}\,90\,g/l and {$<$}\,120\,g/l (female patients) and {$<$}\,130\,g/l (male patients)] who could undergo randomisation and treatment 10-42 days before their operation. INTERVENTION: Double-blinded study comparing placebo of normal saline with 1000\,mg of ferric carboxymaltose administered 10-42 days prior to surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Co-primary end points were risk of blood transfusion or death at 30 days postoperatively, and rate of blood transfusions at 30 days post operation. RESULTS: A total of 487 patients were randomised (243 given placebo and 244 given intravenous iron), of whom 474 completed the trial and provided data for the analysis of the co-primary end points. The use of intravenous iron increased preoperative Hb levels (mean difference 4.7\,g/l, 95\% confidence interval 2.7 to 6.8 g/l; p\,{$<$}\,0.0001), but had no effect compared with placebo on risk of blood transfusion or death (risk ratio 1.03, 95\% confidence interval 0.78 to 1.37; p\,=\,0.84; absolute risk difference +0.8\%, 95\% confidence interval -7.3\% to 9.0\%), or rates of blood transfusion (rate ratio 0.98, 95\% confidence interval 0.68 to 1.43; p\,=\,0.93; absolute rate difference 0.00, 95\% confidence interval -0.14 to 0.15). There was no difference in postoperative complications or hospital stay. The intravenous iron group had higher Hb levels at the 8-week follow-up (difference in mean 10.7\,g/l, 95\% confidence interval 7.8 to 13.7 g/l; p\,{$<$}\,0.0001). There were a total of 71 re-admissions to hospital for postoperative complications in the placebo group, compared with 38 re-admissions in the intravenous iron group (rate ratio 0.54, 95\% confidence interval 0.34 to 0.85; p\,=\,0.009). There were no differences between the groups in terms of mortality (two per group at 30 days post operation) or in any of the prespecified safety end points or serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with anaemia prior to elective major abdominal surgery, there was no benefit from giving intravenous iron before the operation. FUTURE WORK: The impact of iron repletion on recovery from postoperative anaemia, and the association with reduced re-admission to hospital for complications, should be investigated. LIMITATIONS: In the preoperative intravenous iron to treat anaemia in major surgery (PREVENTT) trial, all patients included had anaemia and only 20\% had their anaemia corrected before surgery. The definition and causality of iron deficiency in this setting is not clear. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN67322816 and ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01692418.

METHODS: In a double-blind, parallel-group randomised trial, we recruited adult participants identified with anaemia at preoperative hospital visits before elective major open abdominal surgery at 46 UK tertiary care centres. Anaemia was defined as haemoglobin less than 130 g/L for men and 120 g/L for women. We randomly allocated participants (1:1) via a secure web-based service to receive intravenous iron or placebo 10-42 days before surgery. Intravenous iron was administered as a single 1000 mg dose of ferric carboxymaltose in 100 mL normal saline, and placebo was 100 mL normal saline, both given as an infusion over 15 min. Unblinded study personnel prepared and administered the study drug; participants and other clinical and research staff were blinded to treatment allocation. Coprimary endpoints were risk of the composite outcome of blood transfusion or death, and number of blood transfusions from randomisation to 30 days postoperatively. The primary analysis included all randomly assigned patients with data available for the primary endpoints; safety analysis included all randomly assigned patients according to the treatment received. This study is registered, ISRCTN67322816, and is closed to new participants. FINDINGS: Of 487 participants randomly assigned to placebo (n=243) or intravenous iron (n=244) between Jan 6, 2014, and Sept 28, 2018, complete data for the primary endpoints were available for 474 (97\%) individuals. Death or blood transfusion occurred in 67 (28\%) of the 237 patients in the placebo group and 69 (29\%) of the 237 patients in the intravenous iron group (risk ratio 1{$\cdot$}03, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}78-1{$\cdot$}37; p=0{$\cdot$}84). There were 111 blood transfusions in the placebo group and 105 in the intravenous iron group (rate ratio 0{$\cdot$}98, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}68-1{$\cdot$}43; p=0{$\cdot$}93). There were no significant differences between the two groups for any of the prespecified safety endpoints. INTERPRETATION: Preoperative intravenous iron was not superior to placebo to reduce need for blood transfusion when administered to patients with anaemia 10-42 days before elective major abdominal surgery.

  abstract = {Background \& aims Computed tomographic (CT) imaging at third lumbar vertebra (L3), routinely used by oncologists, represents a reliable tool to quantify muscle mass. A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to assess the efficacy of CT scan to define muscle mass as a prognostic marker in gastric cancer (GC) patients undergoing gastrectomy and/or chemotherapy. The primary outcomes were overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) and the secondary outcomes included postoperative length of hospital stay (P-LOS), total and severe complications in GC patients undergoing gastrectomy. Methods Three electronic bibliographic databases \textemdash{} MEDLINE, Web of Science and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials - were used to conduct a systematic literature search based on fixed inclusion and exclusion criteria, until April 2019. The adjusted and unadjusted hazard ratio (HR), odds ratio (OR) and mean difference (MD) with 95\% confidence interval (CI) were used to analyse the dichotomous variables (OS, RFS, total and severe complications) and continuous variables (P-LOS). Random- and fixed effects models were used according to the heterogeneity. Results A total of 5610~GC patients from 20 studies were identified. Low muscle mass at diagnosis was found in 32.7\% of GC patients and was significantly associated with poorer OS (HR 2.02, 95\% CI 1.71\textendash 2.38, p~{$<~$}0.00001, I2~=~47\%) and worse RFS (HR 1.97, 95\% CI 1.71\textendash 2.26, p~{$<~$}0.00001, I2~=~0\%). Meta-analysis of adjusted HR from multivariable analyses confirmed the association between OS and low muscle mass (HR 1.89, 95\% CI 1.68\textendash 2.12, p~{$<~$}0.00001, I2~=~36\%). Furthermore, low muscle mass and poorer OS were significantly associated in metastatic GC patients exclusively undergoing chemotherapy (HR 1.61, 95\% CI 1.23\textendash 2.11, p~{$<~$}0.0006, I2~=~18\%). Moreover, preoperative low muscle mass was significantly associated with longer P-LOS (MD 1.19, 95\% CI 0.68\textendash 1.71, p~{$<~$}0.00001, I2~=~0\%), higher risk of postoperative complications (OR 1.76, 95\% CI 1.17\textendash 2.66, p~=~0.007, I2~=~77\%) and severe complications (OR 1.54, 95\% CI 1.03\textendash 2.29, p~=~0.04, I2~=~49\%) in GC patients undergoing gastrectomy. Conclusions Low muscle mass, assessed by L3 CT-scan, affects almost 1/3 of GC patients at diagnosis and acts as a negative prognostic marker on many clinical outcomes. Therefore, identifying GC patients with low muscle mass at diagnosis or at follow-up visit should be recommendable. Clinical nutritionists should be part of tumor boards meetings to screen low muscle mass in order to prompt personalized nutritional support.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant therapy is commonly administered to patients with localized disease who have T3-4 esophageal disease as staged by endoscopic ultrasound (EUS). Previously, we noted that patients who present with dysphagia have a higher EUS T stage. We hypothesized that the presence of dysphagia is predictive of EUS T3-4 disease and that staging EUS could be forgone for esophageal cancer patients with dysphagia. METHODS: We performed a prospective, intent-to-treat, single-cohort study in which patients with potentially resectable esophageal cancer completed a standardized four-tier dysphagia score survey. EUS was performed as part of our standard evaluation. To determine whether the presence of dysphagia predicted EUS T3-4 disease, the dysphagia score was compared with EUS T stage. RESULTS: The study enrolled 114 consecutive patients between August 2012 and February 2014: 77\% (88 of 114) received neoadjuvant therapy, 18\% (20 of 114) did not, and 5\% (6 of 114) pursued treatment elsewhere. In total, 70\% (80 of 114) underwent esophagectomy; of these, 54\% (61 of 114) had dysphagia and 46\% (53 of 114) did not. Dysphagia scores were 66\% (40 of 61) grade 1, 25\% (15 of 61) grade 2, and 10\% (6 of 61) grade 3 to 4. Among patients with dysphagia, 89\% (54 of 61) had T3-4 disease by EUS; among those without dysphagia, only 53\% (28 of 53) had T3-4 disease by EUS (p {$<$} 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of dysphagia in patients with esophageal cancer was highly predictive of T3-4 disease by EUS. On the basis of this finding, approximately 50\% of patients currently undergoing staging EUS at our institution could potentially forgo EUS before neoadjuvant therapy. Patients without dysphagia, however, should still undergo EUS.},

  abstract = {Objectives The objective of this systematic review was to assess associations between quantitative body composition measures extracted from imaging examinations and chemotherapy-related toxicity in pancreatic cancer patients. A secondary objective was to evaluate the different definitions of sarcopenia across included studies. Methods This systematic review was conducted according to the PRISMA statement. A comprehensive literature search of three electronic databases was performed by two authors. For each eligible article, information was collected concerning the clinical setting; basic study; population characteristics; technical; body composition features evaluated; CA 19.9 tumor marker levels; chemotherapy drugs administered; toxicities (hematologic, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, neuropathy, reduction of number of cycles, overall toxicity); association of body composition values with toxicities. The overall quality of the included studies was critically evaluated. Results After the initial retrieval of 1137 articles, the systematic review included 12 articles (1/12 in the neo-adjuvant setting; 2/12 in the adjuvant setting; 3/12 in the metastatic setting; 2/12 in the unresectable setting; the other 4/12 included more than one clinical setting). The number of patients included ranged between 17 and 251; mean/median age ranged between 63 and 77 years; the percentage of sarcopenic patients ranged between 23 and 76\%. The most frequent body composition parameter evaluated was skeletal muscle index (11/12). Chemotherapy regimens included gemcitabine (as monotherapy or in combination with other drugs); FOLFIRINOX and S-1. Among the trials including gemcitabine, 2/9 demonstrated an association with toxicity, whereas 7/9 did not; among those including FOLFIRINOX, one demonstrated associated toxicity whereas the others did not. Altogether, 4/12 papers demonstrated an association between the body composition values and the development of chemotherapy-related toxicities. Conclusions There is a wide variability of results about the association of body composition and chemotherapy-related toxicity in PC patients. Furthermore, cut-off values to define sarcopenia in PC patients are not yet uniformly defined.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is no single generally accepted clinical definition of frailty. Previously developed tools to assess frailty that have been shown to be predictive of death or need for entry into an institutional facility have not gained acceptance among practising clinicians. We aimed to develop a tool that would be both predictive and easy to use. METHODS: We developed the 7-point Clinical Frailty Scale and applied it and other established tools that measure frailty to 2305 elderly patients who participated in the second stage of the Canadian Study of Health and Aging (CSHA). We followed this cohort prospectively; after 5 years, we determined the ability of the Clinical Frailty Scale to predict death or need for institutional care, and correlated the results with those obtained from other established tools. RESULTS: The CSHA Clinical Frailty Scale was highly correlated (r = 0.80) with the Frailty Index. Each 1-category increment of our scale significantly increased the medium-term risks of death (21.2\% within about 70 mo, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 12.5\%-30.6\%) and entry into an institution (23.9\%, 95\% CI 8.8\%-41.2\%) in multivariable models that adjusted for age, sex and education. Analyses of receiver operating characteristic curves showed that our Clinical Frailty Scale performed better than measures of cognition, function or comorbidity in assessing risk for death (area under the curve 0.77 for 18-month and 0.70 for 70-month mortality). INTERPRETATION: Frailty is a valid and clinically important construct that is recognizable by physicians. Clinical judgments about frailty can yield useful predictive information.},

An individual's frailty index score reflects the proportion of potential deficits present in that person, and indicates the likelihood that frailty is present. Although based on a simple count, the frailty index shows several interesting properties, including a characteristic rate of accumulation, a submaximal limit, and characteristic changes with age in its distribution. The frailty index, as a state variable, is able to quantitatively summarize vulnerability.

ASCO's Quality Oncology Practice Initiative, an oncologist-led practice-based quality assessment program, includes measures on the basis of these recommendations. METHODS: CW test measures from spring and fall 2013, spring 2014, and spring 2015 were evaluated for concordance rates, change in the concordance over time, and variability by practice characteristics. Practice characteristics recorded included geographic location, academic affiliation, number of new cases, number of medical oncologists, and rounds of participation in Quality Oncology Practice Initiative. Medians, interquartile ranges, and percentages were calculated for concordance with recommendations and practice characteristics. Change in recommendation concordance over time was assessed using linear regression models. RESULTS: From 2013 to 2015, 341 unique oncology practices abstracted the CW measures. Performance varied for specific recommendations. The median concordance was best for measure 1 (patients with low or undocumented performance status who received chemotherapy), where concordance ranged from 78.4\% to 83.3\%. The lowest concordance was for measure 3 (use of biomarkers or advanced imaging tests for surveillance in early breast cancer), where concordance ranged from 67.7\% to 74.2\%. Performance on CW measures varied markedly by individual practice. Variability over time and by practice characteristics was observed. CONCLUSION: Performance on ASCO's CW demonstrates room for improvement. Concordance rates varied substantially by practice. Further education on CW measures is needed to improve patient care and enhance value.},

The NSABP R-03 (National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project R-03) trial compared neoadjuvant versus adjuvant chemoradiotherapy in the treatment of locally advanced rectal carcinoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with clinical T3 or T4 or node-positive rectal cancer were randomly assigned to preoperative or postoperative chemoradiotherapy. Chemotherapy consisted of fluorouracil and leucovorin with 45 Gy in 25 fractions with a 5.40-Gy boost within the original margins of treatment. In the preoperative group, surgery was performed within 8 weeks after completion of radiotherapy. In the postoperative group, chemotherapy began after recovery from surgery but no later than 4 weeks after surgery. The primary end points were disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: From August 1993 to June 1999, 267 patients were randomly assigned to NSABP R-03. The intended sample size was 900 patients. Excluding 11 ineligible and two eligible patients without follow-up data, the analysis used data on 123 patients randomly assigned to preoperative and 131 to postoperative chemoradiotherapy. Surviving patients were observed for a median of 8.4 years. The 5-year DFS for preoperative patients was 64.7\% v 53.4\% for postoperative patients (P = .011). The 5-year OS for preoperative patients was 74.5\% v 65.6\% for postoperative patients (P = .065). A complete pathologic response was achieved in 15\% of preoperative patients. No preoperative patient with a complete pathologic response has had a recurrence. CONCLUSION: Preoperative chemoradiotherapy, compared with postoperative chemoradiotherapy, significantly improved DFS and showed a trend toward improved OS.},

  abstract = {Background \& aims Patients with pancreatic cancer have a poor prognosis, are often cachectic, and frequently demonstrate features of systemic inflammation, which may contribute to the phenomenon of myosteatosis. Analysis of body composition from CT scans has been used to study sarcopenia and its association with prognosis in a number of types of cancer, particular in combination with obesity. It has also been suggested that myosteatosis, defined as attenuated mean skeletal muscle Hounsfield units (HU), is associated with reduced survival in cancer. This study aimed to assess the association between body composition (sarcopenia and myosteatosis) and outcome in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer. Methods All patients diagnosed with unresectable pancreatic cancer at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust between 2006 and 2013 were considered for the study. A total of 228 patients were included retrospectively. Body composition was assessed using cross-sectional CT analysis to calculate a skeletal muscle index (SMI) for sarcopenia and use mean skeletal muscle HU for myosteatosis. Results The prevalence of sarcopenia in the whole patient group at baseline was 60.5\% (138/228). Overall, patients who were sarcopenic had no significant difference in overall survival versus those who were not (p~=~0.779). However, patients who were overweight/obese and sarcopenic had a significantly lower survival (p~=~0.013). Of the 58 patients who were overweight or obese and sarcopenic, 32 were also myosteatotic. The prevalence of myosteatosis overall at baseline was 55.3\% (126/228) and this was associated with significant reduction in overall survival (p~=~0.049). Univariate Cox regression revealed myosteatosis but not sarcopenia to be predictive of reduced survival, however this relationship was lost on multivariate testing. Myosteatosis was associated with significantly greater levels of systemic inflammation (white cell count, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio and C-reactive protein), anaemia and worsening of baseline blood urea. This relationship was not seen with sarcopenia. Conclusions This is the largest study on the association between body composition and survival in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer and has shown that although sarcopenia alone did not have a bearing on survival, the presence of myosteatosis was associated significantly with the presence of systemic inflammation and reduced survival.},

The relationship between frailty scores and SMI with length of stay (LOS) and mortality was determined using logistic regression. Eighty-three patients (59 men; mean age 70.2 {$\pm$} 8.5 years) had chest (n = 50) or abdomen (n = 60) CT scans. Mean TBSA = 14.3 {$\pm$} 14.0\%, LOS = 25.8 {$\pm$} 21.3 days, CFS = 4.36 {$\pm$} 0.99. Sixteen patients (19.3\%) died while in the hospital. CT-derived measurement of SMI at T12 was significantly associated with LOS (P {$<$} .05), but not with mortality (P = .561). CT-derived metrics at L3 were not significantly associated with outcomes. CFS was not associated with LOS (P = .836) or mortality (P = .554). In older burn patients, low SMI of the paraspinal muscles at T12 was associated with longer LOS.},

Our group conducted three phase II trials in elderly patients in recent years. A post-hoc subgroup analysis of 67 patients aged at least 75 years was included in this study. Oxaliplatin was combined with capecitabine in two trials and with uracil-tegafur (UFT) plus folinic acid in the third trial. In one study, bevacizumab was also added to chemotherapy. The median age of patients was 77 years, and all had a good performance status (0 to 1). The observed overall response rate was 45\%, comparable to younger patients (51\%, p = 0.49). The estimated median progression-free survival (PFS) time and overall survival (OS) time were 8.7 and 19.3 months, respectively. These results did not significantly differ from those in younger patients (8.0 months for PFS (p = 0.58) and 19.7 months for OS (p = 0.94), respectively). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events included diarrhea (13\%), fatigue (13\%), peripheral neuropathy (10\%), and neutropenia (7\%). Moreover, the toxicity was never statistically different from that in younger patients. The efficacy of oxaliplatin-based combination was maintained in fit elderly patients {$\geq$}75 years.},

We investigated the prognostic significance of exercise behavior and functional capacity in this population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using a prospective design, 243 patients with WHO grades 3 to 4 recurrent malignant glioma and Karnofsky performance status (KPS) {$\geq$} 70 completed a self-administered questionnaire that assessed exercise behavior and performed a 6-minute walk test (6MWT) to assess functional capacity. Cox proportional models were used to estimate the risk of all-cause mortality according to 6MWT distance (6MWD; {$<$} 390 meters, 390-489 meters, {$>$} 489 meters) and exercise behavior (metabolic equivalent [MET] -h/wk) adjusted for KPS and other important clinical factors. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 27.43 months. During this period, 149 deaths were recorded (61\% of the total sample). Exercise behavior was an independent predictor of survival (P = .0081). Median survival was 13.03 months for patients reporting {$<$} 9 MET-h/wk relative to 21.84 months for those reporting {$\geq$} 9 MET-h/wk. Exercise behavior added incremental prognostic value beyond that provided by KPS, age, sex, grade, and number of prior progressions (P {$<$} .001). Compared with patients reporting {$<$} 9 MET-h/wk, the adjusted hazard ratio for mortality was 0.64 (95\% CI, 0.46 to 0.91) for patients reporting {$\geq$} 9 MET-h/wk. Functional capacity was not an independent predictor of prognosis. CONCLUSION: Exercise behavior is a strong independent predictor of survival that provides incremental prognostic value to KPS as well as traditional markers of prognosis in malignant recurrent glioma.},

METHODS: Four hundred thirteen patients with esophageal cancer who presented to Roswell Park Cancer Institute from 1991 to 1998 were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical data, perioperative details, and postoperative courses were compared for patients older and younger than 70 years. RESULTS: One hundred forty-seven patients (36\%) were older than 70 years. Risk factors, clinical symptoms, histology, and stage at presentation were equivalent for both age groups. A higher percentage of patients {$<$}70 years were candidates for curative resection. There were no significant differences between groups for estimated blood loss, intraoperative transfusions, length of stay, overall morbidity, or mortality. Only postoperative myocardial infarction and atrial fibrillation were increased in the older group. Excluding stage IV disease, there was a significant and similar improvement in median survival after resection for patients both {$<$}70 years and {$>$}70 years. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, esophageal cancer in older patients warrants surgical resection because the benefit to the patient is the same as it is for younger patients, without a significant increase in operative morbidity or mortality.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Few patients 75 years of age and older participate in clinical trials, thus whether adjuvant chemotherapy for stage III colon cancer (CC) benefits this group is unknown. METHODS: A total of 5,489 patients {$\geq$} 75 years of age with resected stage III CC, diagnosed between 2004 and 2007, were selected from four data sets containing demographic, stage, treatment, and survival information. These data sets included SEER-Medicare, a linkage between the New York State Cancer Registry (NYSCR) and its Medicare programs, and prospective cohort studies Cancer Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance Consortium (CanCORS) and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network. Data sets were analyzed in parallel using covariate adjusted and propensity score (PS) matched proportional hazards models to evaluate the effect of treatment on survival. PS trimming was used to mitigate the effects of selection bias. RESULTS: Use of adjuvant therapy declined with age and comorbidity. Chemotherapy receipt was associated with a survival benefit of comparable magnitude to clinical trials results (SEER-Medicare PS-matched mortality, hazard ratio [HR], 0.60; 95\% CI, 0.53 to 0.68). The incremental benefit of oxaliplatin over non-oxaliplatin-containing regimens was also of similar magnitude to clinical trial results (SEER-Medicare, HR, 0.84; 95\% CI, 0.69 to 1.04; NYSCR-Medicare, HR, 0.82, 95\% CI, 0.51 to 1.33) in two of three examined data sources. However, statistical significance was inconsistent. The beneficial effect of chemotherapy and oxaliplatin did not seem solely attributable to confounding. CONCLUSION: The noninvestigational experience suggests patients with stage III CC {$\geq$} 75 years of age may anticipate a survival benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. Oxaliplatin offers no more than a small incremental benefit. Use of adjuvant chemotherapy after the age of 75 years merits consideration in discussions that weigh individual risks and preferences.},

  abstract = {Purpose Performance status (PS) is a prognostic factor in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Clinical trials typically enroll less than 10\% of patients with a PS of 2 (PS2); thus, the benefit of systemic chemotherapy in PS2 patients is uncertain. Patients and Methods Individual data from 6,286 patients (509 PS2 patients) from nine clinical trials were used to compare treatment efficacy by PS. Progression-free survival (PFS), grade {$\geq$} 3 adverse events, 60-day all-cause mortality, overall survival (OS), and response rate (RR) were explored in the full set of nine trials and in the five trials comparing first-line monotherapy with combination therapy. Results Compared with patients with PS of 0 or 1, PS2 patients had significantly higher rates of grade {$\geq$} 3 nausea (8.5\% v 16.4\%, respectively; P {$<$} .0001) and vomiting (7.6\% v 11.9\%, respectively; P = .006) and 60-day all-cause mortality (2.8\% v 12.0\%, respectively; P {$<$} .0001). PS2 was prognostic for PFS (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.52; P {$<$} .0001; median PFS, 7.6 months for PS 0 or 1 v 4.9 months for PS2), OS (HR = 2.18; P {$<$} .0001; median OS, 17.3 months for PS 0 or 1 v 8.5 months for PS2), and RR (odds ratio = 0.61; P {$<$} .0001; 43.8\% for PS 0 or 1 v 32.0\% for PS2). The relative benefit and toxicity of experimental versus control treatment and monotherapy versus combination therapy were not different in PS 0 or 1 patients versus PS2 patients. Conclusion In clinical trials, PS2 patients derive similar benefit from superior treatment as patients with PS of 0 to 1 but with an increased risk of toxicities and 12\% 60-day mortality. Although current treatment provides benefit, new approaches are required to approach 1-year median survival for PS2 patients.},

  abstract = {AIM: The standard treatment for patients with clinically resectable rectal cancer is surgery. Postoperative radiochemotherapy is recommended for patients with advanced disease (pT3/4 or pN+). In recent years, encouraging results of preoperative radiotherapy have been reported. This prospective randomized phase-III trial (CAO/ARO/AIO-94) compares the efficacy of neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy to standard postoperative radiochemotherapy. We report on the design of the study and first results with regard to toxicity of radiochemotherapy and postoperative morbidity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with locally advanced operable rectal cancer (uT3/4 or uN+, Mason CS III/IV) were randomly assigned to pre- or postoperative radiochemotherapy: A total dose of 50.4 Gy (single dose 1.8 Gy) was applied to the tumor and the pelvic lymph nodes. 5-FU (1,000 mg/m2/d) was administered concomitantly in the first and fifth week of radiation as 120-h continuous infusion. Four additional cycles of 5-FU chemotherapy (500 mg/m2/d, i.v. bolus) were applied. Radiochemotherapy was identical in both arms except for a small-volume boost of 5.4 Gy in the postoperative setting. Time interval between radiochemotherapy and surgery was 4-6 weeks in both arms. Techniques of surgery were standardized and included total mesorectal excision. In addition, stratification according to surgeons involved has been provided for. Primary endpoints of the study are 5-year overall-survival, local and distant control, secondary endpoints include rate of curative (R0) resections and sphincter saving procedures, toxicity of radiochemotherapy, surgical complications and quality of life. RESULTS: As of 15th November 2000, 628 patients were randomized from 26 participating institutions: 310 patients were randomized to postoperative radiochemotherapy, 318 patients to preoperative radiochemotherapy. Acute toxicity (WHO) of radiochemotherapy was low, with less than 15\% of patients experiencing Grade 3 or higher toxicity: The principal toxicity was diarrhea, with 12\% in the postoperative radiochemotherapy arm and 10\% in the preoperative radiochemotherapy arm having Grade-3, and 1\% in either arm having Grade-4 diarrhea. Erythema, nausea and leukopenia were the next common toxicities, with less than 3\% of patients in either arm suffering Grade 3 or greater leukopenia or nausea. Postoperative complication rates were similar in both arms, with 12\% (postoperative radiochemotherapy) and 13\% (preoperative radiochemotherapy) of patients, respectively, suffering from anastomotic leakage, 4\% (postoperative radiochemotherapy) and 3\% (preoperative radiochemotherapy) from postoperative bleeding, and 6\% (postoperative radiochemotherapy) and 5\% (preoperative radiochemotherapy) from delayed wound healing. CONCLUSION: The patient accrual of our trial is satisfactory, neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy is well tolerated and bears no higher risk for postoperative morbidity.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Treatment guidelines for stage I-III esophageal cancer indicate that management should include surgery in appropriate patients. Variations in utilization of surgery may contribute to racial differences observed in survival. We sought to identify factors associated with racial disparities in surgical resection of esophageal cancer and evaluate associated survival differences. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with stage I-III esophageal cancer from 2004 to 2015 were identified using the National Cancer Database. Matched patient cohorts were created to reduce confounding. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with receipt of surgery. Multi-level modeling was performed to control for random effects of individual hospitals on surgical utilization. RESULTS: A total of 60,041 patients were included (4402 black; 55,639 white). After 1:1 matching, there were 5858 patients evenly distributed across race. For all stages, significantly fewer black than white patients received surgery. Black race independently conferred lower likelihood of receiving surgery in single-level multivariable analysis (OR (95\% CI); stage I, 0.67 (0.48-0.94); stage II, 0.76 (0.60-0.96); stage III, 0.62 (0.50-0.76)) and after controlling for hospital random effects. Hospital-level random effects accounted for one third of the unexplained variance in receipt of surgery. Risk-adjusted 1-, 3-, and 5-year mortality was higher for patients who did not undergo surgery. CONCLUSION: Black patients with esophageal cancer are at higher risk of mortality compared to white patients. This increased risk may be influenced by decreased likelihood of receiving surgical intervention for resectable disease, in part because of between-hospital differences. Improving access to surgical care may improve disparities in esophageal cancer survival.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Malnutrition after esophageal cancer surgery is associated with reduced health-related qualify of life. Therefore, a prediction model identifying patients at risk for severe weight loss after surgery was developed. METHODS: Data from a Swedish population-based cohort study, including 616 patients undergoing esophageal cancer surgery in 2001-2005, was used. Candidate predictors included risk factors available before and immediately after surgery. Severe weight loss was defined as {$\geq$}\,15\% loss of body weight between the time of surgery and 6~months postoperatively. The prediction model was developed using multivariable models. The accuracy of the model was measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) with bootstrap validation. The model was externally validated in a hospital-based cohort of 91 surgically treated esophageal cancer patients in the United Kingdom in 2011-2016. Each predictor in the final model was assigned a corresponding risk score. The sum of risk scores was equivalent to an estimated probability for severe weight loss. RESULTS: Among the 351 patients with 6~months follow-up data, 125 (36\%) suffered from severe postoperative weight loss. The final prediction model included body mass index at diagnosis, preoperative weight loss, and neoadjuvant therapy. The AUC for the model was 0.78 (95\% CI 0.74-0.83). In the validation cohort, the AUC was 0.76. A clinical risk assessment guide was derived from the prediction model. CONCLUSIONS: This prediction model can preoperatively identify individuals with high risk of severe weight loss after esophageal cancer surgery. Intensive nutritional interventions for these patients are recommended.},

  abstract = {The incidence of esophageal cancer has increased steadily in the last decades in the United States. The aim of this paper was to characterize disparities in esophageal cancer treatment in different racial and socioeconomic population groups and compare long-term survival among different treatment modalities. A retrospective analysis of the National Cancer Database was performed including adult patients ({$\geq$}18 years old) with a diagnosis of resectable (stages I-III) esophageal cancer between 2004 and 2015. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine the odds of being offered no treatment at all and surgical treatment across race, primary insurance, travel distance, income, and education levels. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare 5-year survival rates across different treatment modalities. A total of 60,621 esophageal cancer patients were included. Black patients, uninsured patients, and patients living in areas with lower levels of education were more likely to be offered no treatment. Similarly, black race, female patients, nonprivately insured patients, and those living in areas with lower median residential income and lower education levels were associated with lower rates of surgery. Patients receiving surgical treatment, compared to both no treatment and definitive chemoradiation, had significant better long-term survival in stage I, II, and III esophageal cancer. In conclusion, underserved patients with esophageal cancer appear to have limited access to surgical care, and are, in fact, more likely to not be offered any treatment at all. Considering the survival benefits associated with surgical resection, greater public health efforts to reduce disparities in esophageal cancer are needed.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: After esophagectomy, some patients exceed targeted discharge goal within enhanced recovery after surgery programs. This study reviews the demographics, outcomes, cost, readmission rates, and patient satisfaction for the accelerated recovery (AR) group. METHODS: Between 2010 and 2013, 137 consecutive esophagectomy patients were compared according to the length of hospital stay: AR 5 to 6 days, targeted recovery (TR) 7 to 8 days, and delayed recovery (DR) 9 days or more. RESULTS: The AR patients increased from 3\% to 46\% during the study period. The AR patients were younger, but all groups were comparable regarding comorbidities (Charlson, American Society of Anesthesiologists, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score), cancer stage, and treatment approach. The AR patients were more likely to have neoadjuvant therapy, shorter operations, and less blood loss. The DR patients were more likely to have complications (40\% AR versus 45\% TR versus 90\% DR, p {$<$} 0.001). Inhospital and 90-day mortality was 1.5\%. All AR patients were discharged home (100\% AR versus 87\% TR versus 63\% DR, p {$<$} 0.001), and 30-day readmission rates were comparable between groups (14\% AR versus 19\% TR versus 5\% DR, p~= 0.122). Overall mean costs (\$38,385 AR versus \$41,607 TR versus \$61,199 DR, p~{$<$} 0.001) as well as readmission costs (\$7,470 AR versus \$27,695 TR versus \$33,398 DR, p~= 0.202) were lower in the AR group. Patient satisfaction scores were comparable between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Accelerated recovery is achievable in a significant proportion of patients undergoing esophagectomy. Accelerated recovery is associated with decreased treatment costs but does not lead to increased readmissions or decreased patient satisfaction. Enhanced recovery after surgery programs should be designed to accommodate patients appropriate for AR.},

  abstract = {Cancer is a disease of aging and, as the world's population ages, the number of older persons with cancer is increasing and will make up a growing share of the oncology population in virtually every country. Despite this, older patients remain vastly underrepresented in research that sets the standards for cancer treatments. Consequently, most of what we know about cancer therapeutics is based on clinical trials conducted in younger, healthier patients, and effective strategies to improve clinical trial participation of older adults with cancer remain sparse. This systematic review evaluated published studies regarding barriers to participation and interventions to improve participation of older adults in cancer trials. The quality of the available evidence was low and, despite a literature describing multifaceted barriers, only one intervention study aimed to increase enrollment of older adults in trials. Our findings starkly amplify the paucity of evidence-based effective strategies to improve participation of this underrepresented population in cancer trials. Within these limitations, we provide our opinion on how the current cancer research infrastructure must be modified to accommodate the needs of older patients. We offer several underutilized solutions to expand clinical trials to include older adults with cancer. However, as currently constructed, these recommendations alone will not solve the evidence gap in geriatric oncology, and efforts are needed to meet older and frail adults where they are by expanding clinical trials designed specifically for this population and leveraging real-world data.},

  abstract = {Background: Malnutrition in gastrectomized patients receiving chemotherapy is associated with the susceptibility to chemotherapy-related adverse events. This study evaluated pre-operative nutritional status-related indices associated with adverse events in post-operation gastric cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. Methods: Medical records of 234 gastrectomized patients under adjuvant tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil chemotherapy with extended lymph node dissection were analyzed. Nutritional status assessment included Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA), body weight, body mass index, serum albumin concentration, and Nutrition Risk Index (NRI). Chemotherapy-originated adverse events were determined using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Results: PG-SGA indicated 59\% of the patients were malnourished, and 27.8\% of the patients revealed serious malnutrition with PG-SGA score of {$\geq$}9. Fifteen \% of patients lost {$\geq$}10\% of the initial body weight, 14.5\% of the patients had hypoalbuminemia ({$<$}3.5 g/dL), and 66.2\% had NRI score less than 97.5 indicating moderate to severe malnutrition. Hematological adverse events were present in 94\% ({$\geq$}grade 1) and 16.2\% ({$\geq$}grade 3). Non-hematological adverse events occurred in 95.7\% ({$\geq$}grade1) and 16.7\% ({$\geq$}grade 3) of the patients. PG-SGA and NRI score was not associated with treatment-induced adverse events. Multivariate analyses indicated that female, low body mass index, and hypoalbuminemia were independent risk factors for grade 3/4 hematological adverse events. Age was an independent risk factor for grade 3/4 non-hematological adverse events. Neutropenia was the most frequently occurring adverse event, and associated risk factors were female, total gastrectomy, and hypoalbuminemia. Conclusions: Hypoalbuminemia, not PG-SGA or NRI may predict chemotherapy-induced adverse events in gastrectomized cancer patients.},

  abstract = {Introduction We investigated the associations among frailty, as determined via the comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA), muscle measures (i.e., sarcopenia), and treatment-related toxicity in older adults with cancer in Israel. Materials and methods This prospective cohort study enrolled patients {$\geq$}65~years with newly-diagnosed stage IV lung, breast, or genitourinary cancer. Patients were enrolled and completed CGA before their first line of systemic therapy (chemotherapy, biologic therapy, immunologic therapy, or a combination thereof). CGA was used to classify patients as robust, pre-frail, or frail, and routine pre-treatment computed tomography (CT) images were used to quantify skeletal muscle index (SMI) and skeletal muscle density (SMD) at L3 cross-section. Two sarcopenia definitions were used: i. for women SMI {$<$}41~cm2/m2 regardless of body mass index (BMI), and for men SMI {$<$}43~cm2/m2 for those with BMI of {$<$}25 and~{$<~$}53~cm2/m2 for those with BMI {$\geq$}25; and ii. SMI {$<$}38~cm2/m2 for women and~{$<~$}41~cm2/m2 for men, regardless of BMI. The associations between frailty and muscle measures with the occurrence of at least one adverse event (AE) grade~{$\geq~$}2 were examined using the chi-square test, and logistic regression to determine odds ratio (OR) and 95\% confidence interval (CI). Results In total, 51 patients were included in the analysis. The median (interquartile range) age was 72 (68\textendash 76) years, 30 (59\%) were male, and 26 (51\%) had lung cancer. CGA data were available for 48 patients: fifteen (31\%), thirteen (27\%), and twenty (42\%) were defined as robust, pre-frail, and frail, respectively. Overall, 33 (65\%) were sarcopenic by the first aforementioned definition, and sixteen (31\%) by the second. No statistically significant associations were identified between frailty and having at least one AE grade~{$\geq~$}2, or between frailty and sarcopenia. Statistically significant associations were found between having sarcopenia (the second definition) and having at least one AE grade~{$\geq~$}2 (P~=~0.0217). The corresponding odds ratio (95\% CI) was 4.2 (1.2\textendash 15.0), P~=~0.026. Discussion Our findings suggests that sarcopenia is significantly associated with treatment-related toxicity. Further studies with larger sample sizes are warranted.},

Experimental Design\textemdash Using computerized tomography (CT) images taken for the evaluation of disease burden, skeletal muscle area (SMA) and density (SMD) were measured at the 3rd lumbar vertebrae. Sarcopenia was defined as Skeletal Muscle Index (SMI=SMA/height2) {$\leq$}41. Skeletal Muscle Gauge (SMG) was created by multiplying SMI x SMD. Fisher's exact tests, ttests, the Kaplan-Meier method, and Cox regression modeling were used. Results\textemdash MBC patients (N=40), median age 55 (rang 34\textendash 80), 58\% sarcopenic, median SMG 1296 AU (SD 522). Grade 3\textendash 4 toxicity was found in 57\% of sarcopenic vs 18\% of non-sarcopenic patients (p=0.02). Toxicity-related hospitalizations were also higher in sarcopenic patients (39\% vs 0\%, p=0.005) as were any adverse events -- defined as any grade 3\textendash 4 toxicities, hospitalizations, dose reductions, or dose delay -- (74\% vs 35\%, p=0.02). Low SMG was associated with grade 3\textendash 4 toxicity (p=0.04), hospitalization (p=0.01) and time to treatment failure (for progression or toxicity) (p=0.03). Low SMG had a borderline significant association with any adverse event (p=0.06) and overall survival (p=0.07). Conclusions\textemdash SM measures are associated with toxicity outcomes and survival in MBC patients receiving first line taxane-based chemotherapy.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Barrett's esophagus, a condition of intestinal metaplasia of the esophagus, is associated with an increased risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma. We assessed whether endoscopic radiofrequency ablation could eradicate dysplastic Barrett's esophagus and decrease the rate of neoplastic progression. METHODS: In a multicenter, sham-controlled trial, we randomly assigned 127 patients with dysplastic Barrett's esophagus in a 2:1 ratio to receive either radiofrequency ablation (ablation group) or a sham procedure (control group). Randomization was stratified according to the grade of dysplasia and the length of Barrett's esophagus. Primary outcomes at 12 months included the complete eradication of dysplasia and intestinal metaplasia. RESULTS: In the intention-to-treat analyses, among patients with low-grade dysplasia, complete eradication of dysplasia occurred in 90.5\% of those in the ablation group, as compared with 22.7\% of those in the control group (P{$<$}0.001). Among patients with high-grade dysplasia, complete eradication occurred in 81.0\% of those in the ablation group, as compared with 19.0\% of those in the control group (P{$<$}0.001). Overall, 77.4\% of patients in the ablation group had complete eradication of intestinal metaplasia, as compared with 2.3\% of those in the control group (P{$<$}0.001). Patients in the ablation group had less disease progression (3.6\% vs. 16.3\%, P=0.03) and fewer cancers (1.2\% vs. 9.3\%, P=0.045). Patients reported having more chest pain after the ablation procedure than after the sham procedure. In the ablation group, one patient had upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and five patients (6.0\%) had esophageal stricture. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with dysplastic Barrett's esophagus, radiofrequency ablation was associated with a high rate of complete eradication of both dysplasia and intestinal metaplasia and a reduced risk of disease progression.

  abstract = {Barrett's esophagus (BE) is among the most common conditions encountered by the gastroenterologist. In this document, the American College of Gastroenterology updates its guidance for the best practices in caring for these patients. These guidelines continue to endorse screening of high-risk patients for BE; however, routine screening is limited to men with reflux symptoms and multiple other risk factors. Acknowledging recent data on the low risk of malignant progression in patients with nondysplastic BE, endoscopic surveillance intervals are attenuated in this population; patients with nondysplastic BE should undergo endoscopic surveillance no more frequently than every 3-5 years. Neither routine use of biomarker panels nor advanced endoscopic imaging techniques (beyond high-definition endoscopy) is recommended at this time. Endoscopic ablative therapy is recommended for patients with BE and high-grade dysplasia, as well as T1a esophageal adenocarcinoma. Based on recent level 1 evidence, endoscopic ablative therapy is also recommended for patients with BE and low-grade dysplasia, although endoscopic surveillance continues to be an acceptable alternative. Given the relatively common recurrence of BE after ablation, we suggest postablation endoscopic surveillance intervals. Although many of the recommendations provided are based on weak evidence or expert opinion, this document provides a pragmatic framework for the care of the patient with BE.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The pretreatment prognostic nutritional index (PNI) is an indicator of nutritional and immune status, and has potential use as a predictor of survival in cancer patients. Several retrospective studies have used the PNI to predict the outcome of lung cancer patients receiving different immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), but the results have been inconsistent. The objective of our study is to assess the relationship of pretreatment PNI with survival outcomes in lung cancer patients who received ICI-based treatments by meta-analysis. METHODS: We searched the EMBASE, PubMed, Cochrane Library, American Society of Clinical Oncology, and European Society of Medical Oncology databases to identify studies that reported overall survival (OS) or progression-free survival (PFS) in eligible patients. Eight studies were eligible based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data and pooled indicators were extracted from these studies. Meta-analysis was used to analyze hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) for OS and/or PFS and the prognostic value of pretreatment PNI. We completed the registration of the research protocol (Registration number: INPLASY202240087, DOI number: 10.37766/inplasy2022.4.0087). RESULTS: We analyzed data from 8 eligible studies (831 patients). Meta-analysis showed that relative to patients with low pretreatment PNI, those with a high pretreatment PNI had better OS (HR = 2.50, 95\% CI = 1.44-4.33, P = .001) and better PFS (HR = 1.94, 95\% CI = 1.56-2.42, P {$<$} .001). Sensitivity analysis indicated these results were robust. There was also no evidence of publication bias. CONCLUSION: Lung cancer patients receiving ICI-based treatments who had higher pretreatment PNI had better OS and PFS.},

These guidelines have been developed under the auspices of the American College of Gastroenterology and its Practice Parameters Committee and approved by the Board of Trustees. The following guidelines are based on a critical review of the available scientific literature on the topic identified in Medline and PubMed (January 1992-December 2008) using search terms that included stents, self-expandable metal stents, self-expandable plastic stents, esophageal cancer, esophageal adenocarcinoma, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, esophageal stricture, perforations, anastomotic leaks, tracheoesophageal fistula, and achalasia. These guidelines are intended for use by health-care providers and apply to adult, but not pediatric, patients. As with other practice guidelines, these guidelines are not intended to replace clinical judgment but rather to provide general guidelines applicable to the majority of patients. Clinicians need to integrate recommendations with their own clinical judgment, and with individual patient circumstances, values, and preferences. They are intended to be flexible, in contrast to standards of care, which are inflexible policies designed to be followed in every case. Specific recommendations are based on relevant published information. The quality of evidence and strength of recommendations have been assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system, which is a system that has been adopted by multiple national and international societies. The GRADE system is based on a sequential assessment of quality of evidence, followed by assessment of the balance between benefits vs. downsides (harms, burden, and costs) and subsequent judgment regarding the strength of recommendation.},

In this study, we have compared a simple, novel nutrition screening tool designed for an oncology inpatient setting and the Malnutrition Screening Tool (MST) against the Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA). METHODS: This was an observational study to compare assessment of nutritional status by PG-SGA with nutrition screening using the Royal Marsden Nutrition Screening Tool (RMNST) and the MST. Patients were recruited from a single tertiary cancer centre. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-six oncology inpatients underwent a full nutritional assessment and nutrition screening. The PG-SGA tool identified 90 (71\%) patients as malnourished or at risk and 36 (29\%) patients as well-nourished. The RMNST had a sensitivity of 93\% and a specificity of 53\%, and the MST had a sensitivity of 66\% and a specificity of 83 \%. Predictive value (ROC AUC) of both screening tools was excellent at 0.84 and 0.83 for RMNST and MST, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified a high prevalence of malnutrition in the population with 71\% of patients being identified as malnourished or at risk of malnutrition. The RMNST had an excellent sensitivity for identifying patients who were malnourished or at risk of malnutrition in the inpatient setting although it had a poor specificity. The MST had a poorer sensitivity of 66 \%. We would recommend that the RMNST is trialled in other oncology inpatient settings and also in the outpatient setting.},

This study evaluated the relationship between core muscle size and patient outcomes following esophagectomy for malignancy. Using preoperative computed tomography scans in 230 subjects who had undergone transhiatal esophagectomy for cancer between 2001 and 2010, lean psoas area (LPA), measured at the fourth lumbar vertebra, was determined. Cox proportional hazards regression was employed to analyze overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) adjusted for age, gender, and stage, and the Akaike information criterion was used to determine each covariate contribution to OS and DFS. Univariate analysis demonstrated that increasing LPA correlated with both OS (P = 0.017) and DFS (P = 0.038). In multivariate analysis controlling for patient and tumor characteristics, LPA correlated with OS and DFS in patients who had not received neoadjuvant treatment (n = 64), with higher LPA associated with improved OS and DFS. Moreover, LPA was of equivalent, or slightly higher importance than pathologic stage. These measures were not predictive among patients (n = 166) receiving neoadjuvant chemoradiation. Core muscle size appears to be an independent predictor of both OS and DFS, as significant as tumor stage, in patients following transhiatal esophagectomy. Changes in muscle mass related to preoperative treatment may confound this effect. Assessment of core muscle size may provide an additional objective measure for risk stratification prior to undergoing esophagectomy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) has been advantageous for lowering pulmonary complications compared with open approaches.(1) However, pulmonary complications remain the most common morbidity after surgical resection of esophageal cancer.(2,3) The aim of this prospective, randomized, controlled, clinical trial was designed to see whether low tidal volume (VT) could further minimize pulmonary complications after MIE. METHODS: Between June 2011 and July 2012, a total of 101 patients who underwent MIE received left-lung ventilation during thoracoscopic esophagectomy. All patients received left-lung ventilation during thoracoscopic esophagectomy. Patients were randomly assigned to a low VT (5 mL/kg + 5 cm H2O positive end-expiratory pressure) preserved ventilation (PV) group (n~=~53) and a conventional VT (8 mL/kg) controlled ventilation (CV) group (n~=~48) in the thoracic stage. Alveolar lavage fluid was harvested from the ventilated lung at intubation and at 18 hours after surgery for analysis of interleukin (IL)-1\ss, IL-6, and IL-8 levels. Clinical characteristics, including patient demographics, operation features, and changes in oxygenation index, were recorded and analyzed. Pulmonary complications were identified and statistically compared between the 2 groups. RESULTS: The clinical characteristics and operation features were comparable between the 2 groups. IL-1\ss, IL-6, and IL-8 expressions in preoperative alveolar lavage fluid were similar between the 2 groups. Significantly lower~IL expressions were observed in the PV group than those in the CV group at 18 hours after MIE (IL-1\ss, 25.42 {$\pm$} 31.01 vs 94.96 {$\pm$} 118.24 pg/mL; IL-6, 30.86 {$\pm$} 75.78 vs 92.99 {$\pm$} 72.90 pg/mL; IL-8, 258.75~{$\pm$} 188.24 vs 403.95 {$\pm$} 151.44 pg/mL; all P~{$<~$}.05). The 18-hour postoperative oxygenation index was lower in the CV group than that in the PV group (292.85 {$\pm$} 28.74 vs 326.35 {$\pm$} 34.43; P~=~.046). Pulmonary complications were observed in 18 cases of our series, occurring more frequently on the ventilation side (right, 6 cases; and left, 12 cases). All patients were cured by conservative therapy without severe sequelae. The~occurrence of pulmonary complications in the PV group was lower than that in the CV group (9.43\%~vs~27.08\%; P~=~.021). CONCLUSIONS: Lung injury due to intraoperative single-lung ventilation may contribute to pulmonary complications after MIE. Low VT ventilation could decrease ventilation-associated lung inflammation, thus minimizing pulmonary complications after MIE. Further studies, based on a larger volume of populations, are required to confirm these findings.},

An abdominal image might also provide additional useful information on total body skeletal muscle (SM) and AT volumes with related physiological insights. We therefore investigated the relationships between abdominal SM and AT areas from single images and total body component volumes in a large and diverse sample of healthy adult subjects. Total body SM and AT volumes were derived by whole body multislice magnetic resonance imaging in 123 men [age (mean +/- SD) of 41.6 +/- 15.8 yr; body mass index of 25.9 +/- 3.4 kg/m(2)] and 205 women (age of 47.8 +/- 18.7 yr; body mass index of 26.7 +/- 5.6 kg/m(2)). Single abdominal SM and AT slice areas were highly correlated with total body SM (r = 0.71-0.92; r = 0.90 at L(4)-L(5) intervertebral space) and AT (r = 0.84-0.96; r = 0.94 at L(4)-L(5) intervertebral space) volumes, respectively. R(2) increased by only 5.7-6.1\% for SM and 2.7-4.4\% for AT with the inclusion of subject sex, age, ethnicity, scanning position, body mass index, and waist circumference in the model. The developed SM and AT models were validated in an additional 49 subjects. To achieve equivalent power to a study measuring total body SM or AT volumes, a study using a single abdominal image would require 17-24\% more subjects for SM and 6-12\% more subjects for AT. Measurement of a single abdominal image can thus provide estimates of total body SM and AT for group studies of healthy adults.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The purpose of this randomized controlled trial was to determine if enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) would improve outcomes for three-stage minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE). METHODS: Patients with esophageal cancer undergoing MIE between March 2016 and August 2018 were consecutively enrolled, and were randomly divided into 2 groups: ERAS+group that received a guideline-based ERAS protocol, and ERAS- group that received standard care. The primary endpoint was morbidity after MIE. The secondary endpoints were the length of stay (LOS) and time to ambulation after the surgery. The perioperative results including the Surgical Apgar Score (SAS) and Visualized Analgesia Score (VAS) were also collected and compared. RESULTS: A total of 60 patients in the ERAS+ group and 58 patients in the ERAS- group were included. Postoperatively, lower morbidity and pulmonary complication rate were recorded in the ERAS+ group (33.3\% vs. 51.7\%; p\,=\,0.04, 16.7\% vs. 32.8\%; p\,=\,0.04), while the incidence of anastomotic leakage remained comparable (11.7\% vs. 15.5\%; p\,=\,0.54). There was an earlier ambulation (3 [2-3] days vs. 3 [3-4] days, p\,=\,0.001), but comparable LOS (10 [9-11.25] days vs. 10 [9-13] days; p\,=\,0.165) recorded in ERAS+ group. The ERAS protocol led to close scores in both SAS (7.80\,{$\pm$}\,1.03 vs. 8.07\,{$\pm$}\,0.89, p\,=\,0.21) and VAS (1.74\,{$\pm$}\,0.85 vs. 1.78\,{$\pm$}\,1.06, p\,=\,0.84). CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of an ERAS protocol for patients undergoing MIE resulted in earlier ambulation and lower pulmonary complications, without a change in anastomotic leakage or length of hospital stay. Further studies on minimizing leakage should be addressed in ERAS for MIE.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent recommendations indicate that one red blood cell (RBC) unit should be transfused at a time, with reassessment after each transfusion, which may be extrapolated from literature supporting restrictive transfusion triggers rather than specific evidence. Therefore, two systematic reviews were performed to identify the following: 1) RBC transfusion guidelines and review articles to determine if single- or multiple-unit transfusion strategies are recommended and 2) studies comparing strategies for evidence of benefit. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, National Guideline Clearinghouse, and Trip Database were searched (inception to June 2017). For the first review, the proportion of articles with single/multiple-unit recommendations was assessed and stratified by article type. For the second review, the primary outcome was RBC use. Secondary outcomes included proportion of transfusion episodes using a single-unit strategy, length of stay, and mortality. RESULTS: The first review identified 145 articles for analysis, with 51 transfusion guidelines. Only 14 guidelines (27\%) made a recommendation, with most (93\%) recommending single-unit transfusions. The second review identified seven cohort studies comparing preimplementation and postimplementation of a policy encouraging single-unit transfusion strategies. Meta-analysis could not be performed for outcomes given inconsistencies in reporting. RBC use decreased by approximately 10 to 41\% across studies. CONCLUSION: Transfusion guidelines lack recommendations to transfuse to a single-unit strategy. Mostly retrospective cohort studies (six of seven) are inconsistent in outcome reporting but suggest improved RBC use. Further high-quality studies could identify the benefits of a single-unit transfusion strategy, determine the applicability to different clinical settings, and inform future practice guidelines.},

This body composition phenotype is associated with medical disorders such as metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease and several malignancies including prostate, breast and colorectal cancers. Quantitative assessment of visceral obesity is important for evaluating the potential risk of development of these pathologies, as well as providing an accurate prognosis.

We have consequently used the AEG-criteria (adenocarcinoma of the esophago-gastric junction) for classification and have based the selection of the surgical approach on the anatomic topographic subclassification. METHODS: In the following we report an analysis of a large and homogeneously classified population of 1602 consecutive patients with adenocarcinoma of the esophago-gastric junction, with an emphasis on the surgical approach, the pattern of lymphatic spread, the outcome after surgical treatment and the prognostic factors. Demographic data, morphologic and histopathologic tumor characteristics, and long-term survival rates were compared among the three tumor subclassifiations. RESULTS: The study confirms the marked differences in sex distribution, associated specialized intestinal metaplasia in the esophagus, tumor grading, tumor growth pattern, lymphatic spread, and stage between the three tumor entities. The degree of resection and lymph node status were the dominating independent prognostic factors by multivariate analysis. The data show no significant differences of long-term survival after abdomino-thoracic esophagectomy and extended total gastrectomy in these patients. CONCLUSION: The classification of adenocarcinomas of the esophago-gastric junction in three types, AEG type I, type II and type III shows marked differences between the tumor entities and is recommended for selection of a proper surgical approach. Complete tumor resection and adequate lymphadenectomy are associated with good long-term prognosis. Better surgical management and standardized procedures will improve the outcome also of patients who need to undergo more radical surgery, i.e. abdomino-thoracic esophagectomy.},

DESIGN: Meta-analysis of individual patient data and published summary statistics from trials for which individual patient data could not be obtained from the investigators. STUDIES: All randomised controlled trials comparing palliative chemotherapy with supportive care in patients with advanced colorectal cancer that were identified by computerised and hand searches of the literature, scanning references, and contacting investigators. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Survival, disease progression, quality of life, and toxicity. RESULTS: 13 randomised controlled trials including a total of 1365 patients met the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis of seven trials that provided individual patient data (866 patients) showed that palliative chemotherapy was associated with a 35\% reduction in the risk of death (95\% confidence interval 24\% to 44\%). This translates into an absolute improvement in survival of 16\% at both six and 12 months and an improvement in median survival of 3.7 months. No age related differences were found in the effectiveness of chemotherapy, but elderly patients were under represented in trials. The overall quality of evidence relating to treatment toxicity, symptom control, and quality of life was poor. CONCLUSIONS: Chemotherapy is effective in prolonging time to disease progression and survival in patients with advanced colorectal cancer. The survival benefit may be underestimated in this analysis as some patients in the control arms received chemotherapy.},

BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia is associated with poor survival in gastrointestinal cancer patients, but the role of sarcopenia as prognostic tool in surgical oncology has not been established, and no consensus exists regarding assessment and management of sarcopenic patients. METHODS: We performed a systematic search for citations in EMBASE, Web of Science, and PubMed from 2004 to January 31, 2017. Random effects meta-analyses were used to estimate the pooled risk ratio for postoperative complications by Clavien-Dindo grade (total complications: grade {$\geq$}2; major complications: grade {$\geq$}3) in patients with sarcopenia versus patients without sarcopenia. Stratified analyses were performed by sarcopenia criteria, cutoff level, assessment methods, study quality, cancer diagnosis, and "Enhanced Recovery After Surgery" care. RESULTS: Twenty-nine studies (n = 7176) were included with sarcopenia prevalence ranging between 12\% and 78\%. Preoperative incidence of sarcopenia was associated with increased risk of major complications (risk ratio 1.40; 95\% confidence interval, 1.20-1.64; P {$<$} 0.001; I = 52\%) and total complications (risk ratio 1.35; 95\% confidence interval, 1.12-1.61; P = 0.001; I = 60\%). Moderate heterogeneity was found for both meta-analyses. Subgroup analyses showed that sarcopenia remained a consistent risk factor across stratification by sarcopenia criteria, assessment methods, study quality, and diagnoses. CONCLUSIONS: Sarcopenia was associated with an increased risk of complications after gastrointestinal tumor resection, but lack of methodological consensus hampers the interpretation and clinical utilization of these findings. Combining assessment of muscle mass with measures of physical function may increase the prognostic value and accuracy in preoperative risk stratification.},

We investigated if higher drug doses per kg LBM were associated with increased toxicity in stage IIIB/IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients receiving a first-line chemotherapy regimen dosed according to body surface area (BSA). Methods: Data from patients randomised to receive intravenous gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 plus orally vinorelbine 60 mg/m2 days 1 and 8 in a phase III trial comparing two chemotherapy regimens were analysed. LBM was estimated from assessment of the cross-sectional muscle area at the third lumbar level (L3) on computed tomography images obtained before chemotherapy commenced. Common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) grade 3\textendash 4 haematological toxicity and dose reduction and/or stop of treatment after the first course of chemotherapy were defined as primary and secondary toxicity outcomes. Results: The study sample included 153 patients, mean age was 66 years, 55\% were men, 87\% had disease stage IV and 75\% had performance status (PS) 0\textendash 1. Gemcitabine doses per kg LBM varied from 23.2 to 53.1 mg/kg LBM, and vinorelbine doses from 1.5 to 3.3 mg/kg LBM. Higher doses of gemcitabine per kg LBM were significantly associated with grade 3\textendash 4 haematological toxicity in bivariate (OR = 1.12, 95\% CI 1.03\textendash 1.23, p = 0.008) and multivariate analyses (OR = 1.15, 95\% CI 1.01\textendash 1.29, p = 0.018), as were also higher doses of vinorelbine per kg LBM. No significant association was found between drug doses per kg LBM and dose reduction and/or stop of treatment. Conclusion: The study showed that dose estimates according to BSA lead to a substantial variation in drug dose per kg LBM, and higher doses per kg LBM are a significant predictor for chemotherapy-induced haematological toxicity. The results indicate that taking LBM into account may lead to a better dose individualisation of chemotherapy.},

  abstract = {Background \& aims: Recent research indicates that severe muscular depletion (sarcopenia) is frequent in cancer patients and linked to cachexia and poor survival. Our aim was to investigate if measures of skeletal muscle hold prognostic information in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods: We included NSCLC patients with disease stage IIIB/IV, performance status 0e2, enrolled in three randomised trials of first-line chemotherapy (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1305). Computed tomography (CT) images obtained before start of treatment were used for body composition analyses at the level of the third lumbar vertebra (L3). Skeletal muscle mass was assessed by measures of the cross sectional muscle area, from which the skeletal muscle index (SMI) was obtained. Skeletal muscle radiodensity (SMD) was measured as the mean Hounsfield unit (HU) of the measured muscle area. A high level of mean HU indicates a high SMD. Results: Complete data were available for 734 patients, mean age 65 years. Both skeletal muscle index (SMI) and muscle radiodensity (SMD) varied largely. Mean SMI and SMD were 47.7 cm2/m2 and 37.4 HU in men (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 420), 39.6 cm2/m2 and 37.0 HU in women (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 314). Multivariable Cox regression analyses, adjusted for established prognostic factors, showed that SMD was independently prognostic for survival (Hazard ratio (HR) 0.98, 95\% CI 0.97e0.99, p {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.001), whereas SMI was not (HR 0.99, 95\% CI 0.98e1.01, p {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.329). Conclusion: Low SMD is associated with poorer survival in advanced NSCLC. Further research is warranted to establish whether muscle measures should be integrated into routine practice to improve prognostic accuracy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In a previous meta-analysis, we identified a survival benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy before surgery in patients with resectable oesophageal carcinoma. We updated this meta-analysis with results from new or updated randomised trials presented in the past 3 years. We also compared the benefits of preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy compared with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. METHODS: To identify additional studies and published abstracts from major scientific meetings, we searched Medline, Embase, and Central (Cochrane clinical trials database) for studies published since January, 2006, and also manually searched for abstracts from major conferences from the same period. Only randomised studies analysed by intention to treat were included, and searches were restricted to those databases citing articles in English. We used published hazard ratios (HRs) if available or estimates from other survival data. We also investigated treatment effects by tumour histology and relations between risk (survival after surgery alone) and effect size. FINDINGS: We included all 17 trials from the previous meta-analysis and seven further studies. 12 were randomised comparisons of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy versus surgery alone (n=1854), nine were randomised comparisons of neoadjuvant chemotherapy versus surgery alone (n=1981), and two compared neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (n=194) in patients with resectable oesophageal carcinoma; one factorial trial included two comparisons and was included in analyses of both neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (n=78) and neoadjuvant chemotherapy (n=81). The updated analysis contained 4188 patients whereas the previous publication included 2933 patients. This updated meta-analysis contains about 3500 events compared with about 2230 in the previous meta-analysis (estimated 57\% increase). The HR for all-cause mortality for neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy was 0.78 (95\% CI 0.70-0.88; p{$<$}0.0001); the HR for squamous-cell carcinoma only was 0.80 (0.68-0.93; p=0.004) and for adenocarcinoma only was 0.75 (0.59-0.95; p=0.02). The HR for all-cause mortality for neoadjuvant chemotherapy was 0.87 (0.79-0.96; p=0.005); the HR for squamous-cell carcinoma only was 0.92 (0.81-1.04; p=0.18) and for adenocarcinoma only was 0.83 (0.71-0.95; p=0.01). The HR for the overall indirect comparison of all-cause mortality for neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy was 0.88 (0.76-1.01; p=0.07). INTERPRETATION: This updated meta-analysis provides strong evidence for a survival benefit of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy or chemotherapy over surgery alone in patients with oesophageal carcinoma. A clear advantage of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy over neoadjuvant chemotherapy has not been established. These results should help inform decisions about patient management and design of future trials. FUNDING: Cancer Australia and the NSW Cancer Institute.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Surgical resection of gastric cancer has produced suboptimal survival despite multiple randomized trials that used postoperative chemotherapy or more aggressive surgical procedures. We performed a randomized phase III trial of postoperative radiochemotherapy in those at moderate risk of locoregional failure (LRF) following surgery. We originally reported results with 4-year median follow-up. This update, with a more than 10-year median follow-up, presents data on failure patterns and second malignancies and explores selected subset analyses. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In all, 559 patients with primaries {$\geq$} T3 and/or node-positive gastric cancer were randomly assigned to observation versus radiochemotherapy after R0 resection. Fluorouracil and leucovorin were administered before, during, and after radiotherapy. Radiotherapy was given to all LRF sites to a dose of 45 Gy. RESULTS: Overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) data demonstrate continued strong benefit from postoperative radiochemotherapy. The hazard ratio (HR) for OS is 1.32 (95\% CI, 1.10 to 1.60; P = .0046). The HR for RFS is 1.51 (95\% CI, 1.25 to 1.83; P {$<$} .001). Adjuvant radiochemotherapy produced substantial reduction in both overall relapse and locoregional relapse. Second malignancies were observed in 21 patients with radiotherapy versus eight with observation (P = .21). Subset analyses show robust treatment benefit in most subsets, with the exception of patients with diffuse histology who exhibited minimal nonsignificant treatment effect. CONCLUSION: Intergroup 0116 (INT-0116) demonstrates strong persistent benefit from adjuvant radiochemotherapy. Toxicities, including second malignancies, appear acceptable, given the magnitude of RFS and OS improvement. LRF reduction may account for the majority of overall relapse reduction. Adjuvant radiochemotherapy remains a rational standard therapy for curatively resected gastric cancer with primaries T3 or greater and/or positive nodes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Treatment of patients with non-metastatic, locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) includes pre-operative chemoradiation, total mesorectal excision (TME) and post-operative adjuvant chemotherapy. This trimodality treatment provides local tumor control in most patients; but almost one-third ultimately die from distant metastasis. Most survivors experience significant impairment in quality of life (QoL), due primarily to removal of the rectum. A current challenge lies in identifying patients who could safely undergo rectal preservation without sacrificing survival benefit and QoL. METHODS/DESIGN: This multi-institutional, phase II study investigates the efficacy of total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) and selective non-operative management (NOM) in LARC. Patients with MRI-staged Stage II or III rectal cancer amenable to TME will be randomized to receive FOLFOX/CAPEOX: a) before induction neoadjuvant chemotherapy (INCT); or b) after consolidation neoadjuvant chemotherapy (CNCT), with 5-FU or capecitabine-based chemoradiation. Patients in both arms will be re-staged after completing all neoadjuvant therapy. Those with residual tumor at the primary site will undergo TME. Patients with clinical complete response (cCR) will receive non-operative management (NOM). NOM patients will be followed every 3 months for 2 years, and every 6 months thereafter. TME patients will be followed according to NCCN guidelines. All will be followed for at least 5 years from the date of surgery or--in patients treated with NOM--the last day of treatment. DISCUSSION: The studies published thus far on the safety of NOM in LARC have compared survival between select groups of patients with a cCR after NOM, to patients with a pathologic complete response (pCR) after TME. The current study compares 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) in an entire population of patients with LARC, including those with cCR and those with pCR. We will compare the two arms of the study with respect to organ preservation at 3 years, treatment compliance, adverse events and surgical complications. We will measure QoL in both groups. We will analyze molecular indications that may lead to more individually tailored treatments in the future. This will be the first NOM trial utilizing a regression schema for response assessment in a prospective fashion. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT02008656.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: The watch-and-wait (WW) strategy aims to spare patients with rectal cancer unnecessary resection. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the outcomes of WW among patients with rectal cancer who had a clinical complete response to neoadjuvant therapy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective case series analysis conducted at a comprehensive cancer center in New York included patients who received a diagnosis of rectal adenocarcinoma between January 1, 2006, and January 31, 2015. The median follow-up was 43 months. Data analyses were conducted from June 1, 2016, to October 1, 2018. EXPOSURES: Patients had a clinical complete response after completing neoadjuvant therapy and agreed to a WW strategy of active surveillance and possible salvage surgery (n\,=\,113), or patients underwent total mesorectal excision and were found to have a pathologic complete response (pCR) at resection (n\,=\,136). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Kaplan-Meier estimates were used for analyses of local regrowth and 5-year rates of overall survival, disease-free survival, and disease-specific survival. RESULTS: Compared with the 136 patients in the pCR group, the 113 patients in the WW group were older (median [range], 67.2 [32.1-90.9] vs 57.3 [25.0-87.9] years, P\,{$<$}\,.001) with cancers closer to the anal verge (median [range] height from anal verge, 5.5 [0.0-15.0] vs 7.0 [0.0-13.0] cm). All 22 local regrowths in the WW group were detected on routine surveillance and treated by salvage surgery (20 total mesorectal excisions plus 2 transanal excisions). Pelvic control after salvage surgery was maintained in 20 of 22 patients (91\%). No pelvic recurrences occurred in the pCR group. Rectal preservation was achieved in 93 of 113 patients (82\%) in the WW group (91 patients with no local regrowths plus 2 patients with local regrowths salvaged with transanal excision). At 5 years, overall survival was 73\% (95\% CI, 60\%-89\%) in the WW group and 94\% (95\% CI, 90\%-99\%) in the pCR group; disease-free survival was 75\% (95\% CI, 62\%-90\%) in the WW group and 92\% (95\% CI, 87\%-98\%) in the pCR group; and disease-specific survival was 90\% (95\% CI, 81\%-99\%) in the WW group and 98\% (95\% CI, 95\%-100\%) in the pCR group. A higher rate of distant metastasis was observed among patients in the WW group who had local regrowth vs those who did not have local regrowth (36\% vs 1\%, P\,{$<$}\,.001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A WW strategy for select rectal cancer patients who had a clinical complete response after neoadjuvant therapy resulted in excellent rectal preservation and pelvic tumor control; however, in the WW group, worse survival was noted along with a higher incidence of distant progression in patients with local regrowth vs those without local regrowth.},

Newer techniques of EMR allow removal of larger lesions en-bloc.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Early mortality is a major problem in colorectal cancer (CRC). We have shown that Khorana Score is predictive of early mortality in other cancers. Here, we evaluated the value of this score and other prognostic variables in predicting early mortality in CRC. METHODS: CANTARISK was a prospective, noninterventional, global cohort study in patients with CRC initiating a new chemotherapy regimen. Data were collected at zero, two, four, and six months. Early mortality was defined as death within six months of enrollment. All data were compiled centrally and analyzed after the study closed. Statistically significant univariate associations were tested in multivariable models; adjusted odds ratios (ORs) are presented. Statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: From 2011 to 2012, 1789 CRC patients were enrolled. The median age was 62 years; 71\% were Caucasian. One-third (35\%) had a rectal primary, and 65\% had metastatic disease. There were 184 (10.3\%) patients who died during their first six months in the study. For low, intermediate, and high Khorana Score, there were 8.1\%, 11.2\% and 32.5\% deaths, respectively. In multivariable analyses, Khorana Score was an independent predictor of early death (OR for high/intermediate vs low score = 1.70, P = .0027), in addition to age (OR for each incremental year = 1.03, P = .0014), presence of metastatic disease (OR\,=\,3.28, P {$<$} .0001), and Easter Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status Score of 2 or higher (OR\,=\,3.85, P {$<$} .0001). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that Khorana Score is predictive of early mortality in CRC patients. Intermediate- or high-risk patients, as defined by this score, may benefit from additional interventions aimed at reducing early mortality.},

Chronological age alone is often a poor indicator of the physiological and functional status of older adults, and thus should not be the main factor guiding treatment decisions in oncology. By contrast, a geriatric assessment can provide a much more comprehensive understanding of the functional and physiological age of an older person with cancer. The geriatric assessment is a multidimensional tool that evaluates several domains, including physical function, cognition, nutrition, comorbidities, psychological status, and social support. In this Series paper, we discuss the use of a geriatric assessment-based approach to cancer care, and provide clinicians with tools to better assess the risks and benefits of treatment to engage in shared decision making and provide better personalised care for older people with cancer.},

This study assessed whether immediate preoperative treatment could result in reduced perioperative red blood cell (RBC) transfusions and improved outcome. METHODS: In this single-centre, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group controlled study, patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery with anaemia (n=253; haemoglobin concentration (Hb) {$<$}120 g/L in women and Hb {$<$}130 g/L in men) or isolated iron deficiency (n=252; ferritin {$<$}100 mcg/L, no anaemia) were enrolled. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) with the use of a computer-generated range minimisation (allocation probability 0{$\cdot$}8) to receive either placebo or combination treatment consisting of a slow infusion of 20 mg/kg ferric carboxymaltose, 40\hphantom{,}000 U subcutaneous erythropoietin alpha, 1 mg subcutaneous vitamin B12, and 5 mg oral folic acid or placebo on the day before surgery. Primary outcome was the number of RBC transfusions during the first 7 days. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02031289. FINDINGS: Between Jan 9, 2014, and July 19, 2017, 1006 patients were enrolled; 505 with anaemia or isolated iron deficiency and 501 in the registry. The combination treatment significantly reduced RBC transfusions from a median of one unit in the placebo group (IQR 0-3) to zero units in the treatment group (0-2, during the first 7 days (odds ratio 0{$\cdot$}70 [95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}50-0{$\cdot$}98] for each threshold of number of RBC transfusions, p=0{$\cdot$}036) and until postoperative day 90 (p=0{$\cdot$}018). Despite fewer RBC units transfused, patients in the treatment group had a higher haemoglobin concentration, higher reticulocyte count, and a higher reticulocyte haemoglobin content during the first 7 days (p{$\leq$}0{$\cdot$}001). Combined allogeneic transfusions were less in the treatment group (0 [IQR 0-2]) versus the placebo group (1 [0-3]) during the first 7 days (p=0{$\cdot$}038) and until postoperative day 90 (p=0{$\cdot$}019). 73 (30\%) serious adverse events were reported in the treatment group group versus 79 (33\%) in the placebo group. INTERPRETATION: An ultra-short-term combination treatment with intravenous iron, subcutaneous erythropoietin alpha, vitamin B12, and oral folic acid reduced RBC and total allogeneic blood product transfusions in patients with preoperative anaemia or isolated iron deficiency undergoing elective cardiac surgery.

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: This study compared survival after initial treatment with esophagectomy as primary therapy to induction therapy followed by esophagectomy for patients with clinical T2N0 (cT2N0) esophageal cancer in the National Cancer Database (NCDB). METHODS: Predictors of therapy selection for patients with cT2N0 esophageal cancer in the NCDB from 1998 to 2011 were identified with multivariable logistic regression. Survival was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards methods. RESULTS: Surgery was used in 42.9\% (2057 of 4799) of cT2N0 patients. Of 1599 esophagectomy patients for whom treatment timing was recorded, induction therapy was used in 44.1\% (688). Pretreatment staging was proven accurate in only 26.7\% of patients (210 of 786) who underwent initial surgery without induction treatment and had complete pathologic data available: 41.6\% (n = 327) were upstaged and 31.7\% (n = 249) were downstaged. Adjuvant therapy (chemotherapy or radiation therapy) was given to 50.2\% of patients treated initially with surgery who were found after resection to have nodal disease. There was no significant difference in long-term survival between strategies of primary surgery and induction therapy followed by surgery (median 41.1 versus 41.9 months, p = 0.51). In multivariable analysis, induction therapy was not independently associated with risk of death (hazard ratio [HR], 1.16, p = 0.32). CONCLUSIONS: Current clinical staging for early-stage esophageal cancer is highly inaccurate, with only a quarter of surgically resected cT2N0 patients found to have had accurate pretreatment staging. Induction therapy for patients with cT2N0 esophageal cancer in the NCDB is not associated with improved survival.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Social determinants of health affect diagnosis and delivery of care to patients with esophageal cancer. This study hypothesized that hospital safety-net burden affects presentation, treatment, and outcomes in patients with esophageal cancer. METHODS: The National Cancer Database was queried for patients with esophageal cancer (2004 to 2013). Treating facilities were categorized according to their relative burden of uninsured or Medicaid-insured patients. Hospitals with low (LBH), medium (MBH), and high (HBH) safety-net burden were compared with respect to patient demographics, disease and treatment characteristics, and survival using {$\chi$}2 analysis, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and multivariable modeling. RESULTS: There were 56,115 patients from 1,215 facilities. HBH treated a greater proportion of racial and ethnic minorities and patients with lower socioeconomic status. Patients at HBH presented at later stages and received primary surgical therapy less often than at MBH and LBH. Survival for patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma did not differ significantly between HBH and LBH after adjusting for age, sex, race, ethnicity, income, comorbidity, stage, histologic type, tumor location, facility type, insurance status, and treatment modality (hazard ratio, 1.06; 95\% confidence interval, 0.99 to 1.14; p~= 0.093). HBH were associated with a higher mortality risk than LBH for patients with squamous cell carcinoma (hazard ratio, 1.11; 95\% confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.20; p~= 0.014). CONCLUSIONS: There is a mortality risk for patients with squamous cell carcinoma, but not for adenocarcinoma at HBH compared with LBH. Further analysis of unadjusted variables such as performance status, completion of therapy, and continuity of care, and others should be undertaken among safety-net hospitals with the goal of creating appropriate clinical pathways for care of esophageal cancer in vulnerable populations.},

  abstract = {Background Esophageal cancer remains a disease with poor survival and many complications. Measuring muscle mass and quality can identify patients with diminished muscle mass (sarcopenia) and muscle fat infiltration (myosteatosis). We studied the impact of sarcopenia and myosteatosis in resectable esophageal cancer on overall survival and complications. Patients and methods 139 patients received a radical esophagectomy. Skeletal muscle area (SMA) and muscle attenuation (MA) in CT images at L3 level were recorded and groups with and without sarcopenia and myosteatosis were compared for overall survival (OS), perioperative mortality, conduit complications, pleuropulmonary complications, respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation and other significant complications. Results Prevalence of sarcopenia and myosteatosis at presentation was 16.5\% and 51.8\%, respectively. Both were associated with decreased OS. Median survival was 18.3 months (CI 5.4\textendash 31.1) vs 31.0 months (CI 7.4\textendash 54.6) for sarcopenia/no sarcopenia (log rank p = 0.042) and 19.0 months (CI 13.3\textendash 24.7) vs 57.1 months (CI 15.2\textendash 99.0) for myosteatosis (log rank p = 0.044), respectively. A relationship between sarcopenia and myosteatosis and other negative outcomes after esophagectomy could not be established. Conclusions Sarcopenia and myosteatosis before esophagectomy are associated with decreased overall survival but not with more frequent perioperative complications. Identification of patients at risk can guide therapeutic decisions and interventions aimed at replenishing muscle reserves.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Results of the PreOperative therapy in Esophagogastric adenocarcinoma Trial (POET) showed some benefits when including radiotherapy into the preoperative treatment. This article is reporting long-term results of this phase III study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with locally advanced adenocarcinomas of the oesophagogastric junction (Siewert types I-III) were eligible. Randomisation was done to chemotherapy (group A) or induction chemotherapy and chemoradiotherapy (CRT; group B) followed by surgery. RESULTS: The primary end-point of the study was overall survival at 3 years. The study was closed early after 119 patients having been randomised and were eligible. Local progression-free survival after tumour resection was significantly improved by CRT (hazard ratio [HR] 0.37; 0.16-0.85, p~=~value 0.01) and 20 versus 12 patients were free of local tumour progression at 5 years (p~=~0.03). Although the rate of postoperative in-hospital mortality was somewhat higher with CRT (10.2\% versus 3.8\%, p~=~0.26), more patients were alive at 3 and 5 years after CRT (46.7\% and 39.5\%) compared with chemotherapy (26.1\% and 24.4\%). Thus, overall survival showed a trend in favour of preoperative CRT (HR 0.65, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.42-1.01, p~=~0.055). CONCLUSION: Although the primary end-point overall survival of the study was not met, our long-term follow-up data suggest a benefit in local progression-free survival when radiotherapy was added to preoperative chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the oesophagogastric junction.},

The value of adding surgery to chemotherapy and radiotherapy is unknown. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the esophagus were randomly allocated to either induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy (40 Gy) followed by surgery (arm A), or the same induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy (at least 65 Gy) without surgery (arm B). Primary outcome was overall survival time. RESULTS: The median observation time was 6 years. The analysis of 172 eligible, randomized patients (86 patients per arm) showed overall survival to be equivalent between the two treatment groups (log-rank test for equivalence, P {$<$} .05). Local progression-free survival was better in the surgery group (2-year progression-free survival, 64.3\%; 95\% CI, 52.1\% to 76.5\%) than in the chemoradiotherapy group (2-year progression-free survival, 40.7\%; 95\% CI, 28.9\% to 52.5\%; hazard ratio [HR] for arm B v arm A, 2.1; 95\% CI, 1.3 to 3.5; P = .003). Treatment-related mortality was significantly increased in the surgery group than in the chemoradiotherapy group (12.8\% v 3.5\%, respectively; P = .03). Cox regression analysis revealed clinical tumor response to induction chemotherapy to be the single independent prognostic factor for overall survival (HR, 0.30; 95\% CI, 0.19 to 0.47; P {$<$} .0001). CONCLUSION: Adding surgery to chemoradiotherapy improves local tumor control but does not increase survival of patients with locally advanced esophageal SCC. Tumor response to induction chemotherapy identifies a favorable prognostic group within these high-risk patients, regardless of the treatment group.},

Adding radiation therapy to preoperative chemotherapy appears promising, but its definitive value remains unknown. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with locally advanced (uT3-4NXM0) adenocarcinoma of the lower esophagus or gastric cardia were randomly allocated to one of two treatment groups: induction chemotherapy (15 weeks) followed by surgery (arm A); or chemotherapy (12 weeks) followed by chemoradiotherapy (3 weeks) followed by surgery (arm B). Primary outcome was overall survival time. A total of 354 patients were needed to detect a 10\% increase in 3-year survival from 25\% to 35\% by addition of radiation therapy. The study was prematurely closed due to low accrual. RESULTS: The median observation time was 46 months. A total of 126 patients were randomly assigned and 119 eligible patients were evaluated. The number of patients undergoing complete tumor resection was not different between treatment groups (69.5\% v 71.5\%). Patients in arm B had a significant higher probability of showing pathologic complete response (15.6\% v 2.0\%) or tumor-free lymph nodes (64.4\% v 37.7\%) at resection. Preoperative radiation therapy improved 3-year survival rate from 27.7\% to 47.4\% (log-rank P = .07, hazard ratio adjusted for randomization strata variables 0.67, 95\% CI, 0.41 to 1.07). Postoperative mortality was nonsignificantly increased in the chemoradiotherapy group (10.2\% v 3.8\%; P = .26). CONCLUSION: Although the study was closed early and statistical significance was not achieved, results point to a survival advantage for preoperative chemoradiotherapy compared with preoperative chemotherapy in adenocarcinomas of the esophagogastric junction.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate 3-year survival following a randomized controlled trial comparing minimally invasive with open esophagectomy in patients with esophageal cancer. BACKGROUND: Research on minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) has shown faster postoperative recovery and a marked decrease in pulmonary complications. Debate is ongoing as to whether the procedure is equivalent to open resection regarding oncologic outcomes. The study is a follow-up study of the TIME-trial (traditional invasive vs minimally invasive esophagectomy, a multicenter, randomized trial). METHODS: Between June 2009 and March 2011, patients with a resectable intrathoracic esophageal carcinoma, including the gastroesophageal junction tumors (Siewert I), were randomized between open and MI esophagectomy with curative intent. Primary outcome was 3-year disease-free survival. Secondary outcomes include overall survival, lymph node yield, short-term morbidity, mortality, complications, radicality, local recurrence, and metastasis. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. This trial is registered with the Netherlands Trial Register, NTR TC 2452. Both trial protocol and short-term results have been published previously. RESULTS: One hundred fifteen patients were included from 5 European hospitals and randomly assigned to open (n = 56) or MI esophagectomy (n = 59). Combined overall 3-year survival was 40.4\% (SD 7.7\%) in the open group versus 50.5\% (SD 8\%) in the minimally invasive group (P = 0.207). The hazard ratio (HR) is 0.883 (0.540 to 1.441) for MIE compared with open surgery. Disease-free 3-year survival was 35.9\% (SD 6.8\%) in the open versus 40.2\% (SD 6.9\%) in the MI group [HR 0.691 (0.389 to 1.239). CONCLUSIONS: The study presented here depicted no differences in disease-free and overall 3-year survival for open and MI esophagectomy. These results, together with short-term results, further support the use of minimally invasive surgical techniques in the treatment of esophageal cancer.},

Physical performance measures, such as gait speed, might help account for variability, allowing clinicians to make more individualized estimates. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship between gait speed and survival. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Pooled analysis of 9 cohort studies (collected between 1986 and 2000), using individual data from 34,485 community-dwelling older adults aged 65 years or older with baseline gait speed data, followed up for 6 to 21 years. Participants were a mean (SD) age of 73.5 (5.9) years; 59.6\%, women; and 79.8\%, white; and had a mean (SD) gait speed of 0.92 (0.27) m/s. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Survival rates and life expectancy. RESULTS: There were 17,528 deaths; the overall 5-year survival rate was 84.8\% (confidence interval [CI], 79.6\%-88.8\%) and 10-year survival rate was 59.7\% (95\% CI, 46.5\%-70.6\%). Gait speed was associated with survival in all studies (pooled hazard ratio per 0.1 m/s, 0.88; 95\% CI, 0.87-0.90; P {$<$} .001). Survival increased across the full range of gait speeds, with significant increments per 0.1 m/s. At age 75, predicted 10-year survival across the range of gait speeds ranged from 19\% to 87\% in men and from 35\% to 91\% in women. Predicted survival based on age, sex, and gait speed was as accurate as predicted based on age, sex, use of mobility aids, and self-reported function or as age, sex, chronic conditions, smoking history, blood pressure, body mass index, and hospitalization. CONCLUSION: In this pooled analysis of individual data from 9 selected cohorts, gait speed was associated with survival in older adults.},

We aim to discuss the prevalence of sarcopenia and its relation to the oncological outcome. METHODS: Embase, Medline, PubMed, and the Cochrane library were systematically searched for related keywords. Studies using CT to assess sarcopenia and evaluate its relationship with the outcome of GI oncological patients were included. Long-term outcomes, including overall survival and disease-free survival, were compared by hazard ratios (HRs) with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). Short-term outcomes, including total complications and major complications (Clavien-Dindo {$\geq$}IIIa) after curable surgery, were compared by the risk ratio (RR) and 95\% CI. RESULTS: A total of 70 studies including 21,875 patients were included in our study. The median incidence of sarcopenia was 34.7\% (range from 2.1 to 83.3\%). A total of 88.4\% of studies used skeletal muscle index (SMI) in the third lumbar level on CT to define sarcopenia, and a total of 19 cut-offs were used to define sarcopenia. An increasing trend was found in the prevalence of sarcopenia when the cut-off of SMI increased ({$\beta$}\,=\,0.22, 95\% CI\,=\,0.12-0.33, p\,{$<$}\,0.001). The preoperative incidence of sarcopenia was associated both with an increased risk of overall mortality (HR\,=\,1.602, 95\% CI\,=\,1.369-1.873, P\,{$<$}\,0.001) and with disease-free mortality (HR\,=\,1.461, 95\% CI\,=\,1.297-1.646, P\,{$<$}\,0.001). Moreover, preoperative sarcopenia was a risk factor for both total complications (RR\,=\,1.188, 95\% CI\,=\,1.083-1.303, P\,{$<$}\,0.001) and major complications (RR\,=\,1.228, 95\% CI\,=\,1.042-1.448, P\,=\,0.014). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of sarcopenia depends mostly on the diagnostic cut-off points of different criteria. Preoperative sarcopenia is a risk factor for both long-term and short-term outcomes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The modified frailty index (mFI-11) is a NSQIP-based 11-factor index that has been proven to adequately reflect frailty and predict mortality and morbidity. These 11 factors, made of 16 variables, map to the original 70-item Canada Study of Health and Aging Frailty Index. In past years, certain NSQIP variables have been removed from the database; as of 2015, only 5 of the original 11 factors remained. The predictive power and usefulness of these 5 factors in an index (mFI-5) have not been proven in past literature. The goal of our study was to compare the mFI-5 to the mFI-11 in terms of value and predictive ability for mortality, postoperative infection, and unplanned 30-day readmission. STUDY DESIGN: The mFI was calculated by dividing the number of factors present for a patient by the number of available factors for which there were no missing data. Spearman's rho was used to assess correlation between the mFI-5 and mFI-11. Predictive models, using both unadjusted and adjusted logistic regressions, were created for each outcome for 9 surgical subspecialties using 2012 NSQIP data, the last year all mFI-11 variables existed. RESULTS: Correlation between the mFI-5 and mFI-11 was above 0.9 across all surgical specialties except for cardiac and vascular surgery. Adjusted and unadjusted models showed similar c-statistics for mFI-5 and mFI-11, and strong predictive ability for mortality and postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS: The mFI-5 and the mFI-11 are equally effective predictors in all sub-specialties and the mFI5 is a strong predictor of mortality and postoperative complications. It has credibility for future use to study frailty within the NSQIP database. It also has potential in other databases and for clinical use.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Patients with esophageal carcinoma (EC) who are treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy (bimodality therapy [BMT]) experience frequent relapses. In a large cohort, we assessed the timing, frequency, and types of relapses during an aggressive surveillance program and the value of the salvage strategies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with EC (N = 276) who received BMT were analyzed. Patients who had surgery within 6 months of chemoradiotherapy were excluded to reduce bias. We focused on local relapse (LR) and distant metastases (DM) and the salvage treatment of patients with LR only. Standard statistical methods were applied. RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 54.3 months (95\% CI, 48.4 to 62.4). First relapses included LR only in 23.2\% (n = 64), DM with or without LR in 43.5\% (n = 120), and no relapses in 33.3\% (n = 92) of patients. Final relapses included no relapses in 33.3\%, LR only in 14.5\%, DM only in 15.9\%, and DM plus LR in 36.2\% of patients. Ninety-one percent of LRs occurred within 2 years and 98\% occurred within 3 years of BMT. Twenty-three (36\%) of 64 patients with LR only underwent salvage surgery, and their median overall survival was 58.6 months (95\% CI, 28.8 to not reached) compared with those patients with LR only who were unable to undergo surgery (9.5 months; 95\% CI, 7.8 to 13.3). CONCLUSION: Unlike in patients undergoing trimodality therapy, for whom surveillance/salvage treatment plays a lesser role,(1) in the BMT population, approximately 8\% of all patients (or 36\% of patients with LR only) with LRs occurring more than 6 months after chemoradiotherapy can undergo salvage treatment, and their survival is excellent. Our data support vigilant surveillance, at least in the first 24 months after chemotherapy, in these patients.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The primary purpose of surveillance of patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) and/or esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma after local therapy (eg, chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery or trimodality therapy [TMT]) is to implement a potentially beneficial salvage therapy to overcome possible morbidity/mortality caused by locoregional failure (LRF). However, the benefits of surveillance are not well understood. We report on LRFs and salvage strategies in a large cohort. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2000 and 2010, 518 patients with EAC who completed TMT were analyzed for the frequency of LRF over time and salvage therapy outcomes. Standard statistical techniques were used. RESULTS: For 518 patients, the median follow-up time was 29.3 months (range, 1 to 149 months). Distant metastases (with or without LRF) occurred in 188 patients (36\%), and LRF only occurred in 27 patients (5\%). Eleven of 27 patients had lumen-only LRF. Most LRFs (89\%) occurred within 36 months of surgery. Twelve patients had salvage chemoradiotherapy, but only five survived more than 2 years. Four patients needed salvage surgery, and three who survived more than 2 years developed distant metastases. The median overall survival of 27 patients with LRF was 17 months, and 10 patients (37\%) survived more than 2 years. Thus, only 2\% of all 518 patients benefited from surveillance/salvage strategies. CONCLUSION: Our surveillance strategy, which is representative of many others currently being used, raises doubts about its effectiveness and benefits (along with concerns regarding types and times of studies and costs implications) to patients with EAC who have LRF only after TMT. Fortunately, LRFs are rare after TMT, but the salvage strategies are not highly beneficial. Our data can help develop an evidence-based surveillance strategy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Assessment of preoperative physiological status is crucial for optimizing clinical outcomes in patients undergoing surgery for esophageal carcinoma (EC). We aimed to evaluate the prognostic impact of pulmonary dysfunctions and their relationships with other physiological factors, especially sarcopenia, in EC patients receiving esophagectomy. METHODS: In total, 411 EC patients who underwent esophagectomy between 2006 and 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. Preoperative pulmonary functions were evaluated based on \%vital capacity (\%VC) and forced expiratory volume (FEV) 1.0\%. The thresholds were set as the lowest quartile (99\% for \%VC and 68.6\% for FEV1.0\%) in this cohort. RESULTS: One hundred and two patients (24.8\%) had low \%VC (\%VC\,{$<$}\,99\%), which was significantly associated with age, comorbidity, sarcopenia and postoperative complications, while not correlating with pathological variables. The overall survival (OS) of patients in the low \%VC group was significantly poorer than that of those in the high \%VC group (P\,{$<$}\,0.001), especially in those with pStage 0-II diseases (P\,{$<$}\,0.001). In contrast, survival was not stratified by FEV1.0\% (P\,=\,0.80). Notably, patients with both low \%VC and sarcopenia showed very poor 5-year OS (30.3\%). Multivariate analysis revealed low \%VC to be independently associated with poor OS (P\,=\,0.03). In the cause-specific survival analyses, low \%VC was an independent predictor of deaths from non-EC-related causes (P\,=\,0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative low \%VC was independently associated with poor survival outcomes, especially when present in combination with sarcopenia, due to an increased risk of death from non-EC-related causes. Preoperative spirometry testing is useful for predicting long-term outcomes in EC patients undergoing esophagectomy.},

Results: Of 118 patients, 89\% had baseline sarcopenia and 31\% developed muscle loss. Muscle loss was significantly associated with shorter TTF and OS and was an independent prognostic factor for both these parameters; poor performance status and poorer differentiation on histology were also significant predictors of shorter OS.

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Palliative care is a patient-centered approach associated with improvements in quality of life; however, results regarding its association with a survival benefit have been mixed, which may be a factor in its underuse. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether early palliative care is associated with a survival benefit among patients with advanced lung cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective population-based cohort study was conducted among patients with lung cancer who were diagnosed with cancer between January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2013, with follow-up until January 23, 2017. Participants comprised 23\,154 patients with advanced lung cancer (stage IIIB and stage IV) who received care in the Veterans Affairs health care system. Data were analyzed from February 15, 2019, to April 28, 2019. EXPOSURE: Palliative care defined as a specialist-delivered palliative care encounter received after lung cancer diagnosis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was survival. The association between palliative care and place of death was also examined. Propensity score and time-varying covariate methods were used to calculate Cox proportional hazards and to perform regression modeling. RESULTS: Of the 23\,154 patients enrolled in the study, 57\% received palliative care. The mean (SD) age of participants was 68 (9.5) years, and 98\% of participants were men. An examination of the timing of palliative care receipt relative to cancer diagnosis found that palliative care received 0 to 30 days after diagnosis was associated with decreases in survival (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR],\,2.13; 95\% CI, 1.97-2.30), palliative care received 31 to 365 days after diagnosis was associated with increases in survival (aHR, 0.47; 95\% CI, 0.45-0.49), and palliative care received more than 365 days after diagnosis was associated with no difference in survival (aHR, 1.00; 95\% CI, 0.94-1.07) compared with nonreceipt of palliative care. Receipt of palliative care was also associated with a reduced risk of death in an acute care setting (adjusted odds ratio, 0.57; 95\% CI, 0.52-0.64) compared with nonreceipt of palliative care. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results suggest that palliative care was associated with a survival benefit among patients with advanced lung cancer. Palliative care should be considered a complementary approach to disease-modifying therapy in patients with advanced lung cancer.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: There are a large number of randomized controlled trials involving chemotherapy in the management of advanced pancreatic cancer. Several chemotherapeutic agents, either alone or in combination with other chemotherapy or novel agents, have been used. The aim of these meta-analyses was to examine the different therapeutic approaches, and the comparisons examined were as follows: chemotherapy versus best supportive care; fluorouracil (FU) versus FU combination chemotherapy; gemcitabine versus FU; and gemcitabine versus gemcitabine combination chemotherapy. METHODS: Relevant trials were identified by searching databases, trial registers, and conference proceedings. The primary end point was overall survival. RESULTS: One hundred thirteen randomized controlled trials were identified, of which 51 trials involving 9,970 patients met the inclusion criteria. Chemotherapy improved survival compared with best supportive care (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.64; 95\% CI, 0.42 to 0.98). FU-based combination chemotherapy did not result in better overall survival compared with FU alone (HR = 0.94; 95\% CI, 0.82 to 1.08). There was insufficient evidence of a survival difference between gemcitabine and FU, but the wide CI includes clinically important differences in both directions, making a clear conclusion difficult (HR = 0.75; 95\% CI, 0.42 to 1.31). Survival was improved after gemcitabine combination chemotherapy compared with gemcitabine alone (HR = 0.91; 95\% CI, 0.85 to 0.97). CONCLUSION: There was a significant survival benefit for chemotherapy over best supportive care and gemcitabine combinations over gemcitabine alone. This supports the use of gemcitabine-based combination chemotherapy in the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: In the older patients with cancer, the combination of aging and cancer makes sarcopenia more likely to occur. However, previous studies paid less attention to the sarcopenia of older patients with cancer. To address these gaps, we conducted a scoped review of the prevalence, measurement, prognostic value, and clinical interventions of sarcopenia in this population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive search of PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Web of Science, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and Wangfang electronic databases was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Extension for Scoping Reviews. Two independent reviewers screened all abstracts and full-text studies for inclusion. RESULTS: We identified 10,850 studies, and 39 met the inclusion criteria. Two reviewers extracted data on study characteristics, study design, measuring tools and main outcomes. This review included works from 11 countries. All studies were quantitative and most used a cross-sectional (n~=~17) or retrospective (n~=~16) design. The prevalence of sarcopenia in elderly cancer survivors ranged from 18.5\% to 83\%, and skeletal muscle mass index (SMI) by computed tomography (CT) scan at lumbar 3 (L3) was the most commonly used way to define sarcopenia. Meanwhile, pre-therapeutic sarcopenia was significantly related to postoperative complications, lower overall survival and impaired physical function. DISCUSSION: This review emphasizes sarcopenia is highly prevalent in older patients with cancer, which leads to poor outcomes and urgently needs attention from nutritionists, surgeons, oncologists, psychologists and nurses.},

METHODS: Between March 1987 and February 1990, we randomly assigned 1168 patients younger than 80 years of age who had resectable rectal cancer to undergo preoperative irradiation (25 Gy delivered in five fractions in one week) followed by surgery within one week or to have surgery alone. RESULTS: The irradiation did not increase postoperative mortality. After five years of follow-up, the rate of local recurrence was 11 percent (63 of 553 patients) in the group that received radiotherapy before surgery and 27 percent (150 of 557) in the group treated with surgery alone (P{$<$}0.001). This difference was found in all subgroups defined according to Dukes' stage. The overall five-year survival rate was 58 percent in the radiotherapy-plus-surgery group and 48 percent in the surgery-alone group (P=0.004). The cancer-specific survival rates at nine years among patients treated with curative resection were 74 percent and 65 percent, respectively (P=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: A short-term regimen of high-dose preoperative radiotherapy reduces rates of local recurrence and improves survival among patients with resectable rectal cancer.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study evaluates the utility of positron emission tomography (PET), endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), and computed tomographic (CT) scans to predict pathologic response and survival following preoperative chemoradiation (CRT) in esophageal cancer. METHODS: One hundred three sequential patients with locoregionally advanced esophageal cancer, who were treated with CRT and esophageal resection between May 2001 and November 2003 at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, were retrospectively reviewed. PET, EUS, and CT were performed before (pre) or after (post) CRT and before surgical resection. PET standardized uptake value (SUV) was defined as maximal uptake in primary tumor. RESULTS: Most patients were male (91 [88\%]) with adenocarcinoma (90 [87\%]). Pretreatment clinical stages were: IIA (42 [41\%]), IIB (5 [5\%]), III (50 [49\%]), and IVA (6 [6\%]). At the time of surgery, 58 patients (56\%) had a pathologic response to CRT ({$<$} or =10\% viable cells). Post-CRT measurements that correlated with pathologic response were: CT esophageal wall thickness (13.3 vs 15.3 mm, p = 0.04), EUS mass size (0.7 vs 1.7 cm, p = 0.01) and PET SUV (3.1 vs 5.8, p = 0.01). Post-CRT PET SUV equal to or greater than 4 had the highest accuracy for pathologic response (76\%). Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated that a post-CRT PET SUV equal to or greater than 4 was an independent predictor of survival (HR, 3.5, p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: The FDG-PET SUV is the most accurate noninvasive test to predict long-term survival after preoperative CRT and before surgical resection. Post-CRT FDG-PET cannot, however, rule out residual microscopic disease so esophagectomy should remain a therapeutic option even if the post-CRT imaging modalities are normal.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Some patients and oncologists choose to treat localized esophageal cancer with definitive chemotherapy and radiation therapy rather than surgery. A subset of these patients have local relapse without distant metastases and therefore have no other curative intent treatment option but salvage esophagectomy. METHODS: We reviewed our experience with salvage esophagectomy from 1987 to 2000 at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (n = 13, salvage after chemotherapy and radiotherapy group) and compared the data with those of patients receiving esophagectomy in a planned fashion 4 to 6 weeks after preoperative chemotherapy and radiation therapy (n = 99, preoperative chemotherapy and radiotherapy group). RESULTS: Increases in morbidity were seen after resection in the salvage after chemotherapy and radiotherapy group relative to the preoperative chemotherapy and radiotherapy group: mechanical ventilation (9.0 days vs 3.3 days, P =.08), intensive care unit stay (11.2 days vs 5.1 days, P =.07), hospital stay (29.4 days vs 18.4 days, P =.03), and anastomotic leak rates (5/13 [39\%] vs 7/99 [7\%], P =.005). Operative mortality (within 30 days) also tended to be increased statistically nonsignificantly (2/13 [15\%] vs 6/99 [6\%], P =.2). Salvage esophagectomy resulted in long-term survival (25\% 5-year survival) in a subset of patients. Improved survival after salvage esophagectomy was associated with early pathologic stage (T1 N0, T2 N0), prolonged time to relapse, and R0 surgical resection. CONCLUSION: Patients who undergo salvage esophagectomy for relapse of tumor after definitive chemoradiation therapy have increased morbidity, mortality, and hospital use relative to patients undergoing planned esophagectomy after preoperative chemoradiation. Nevertheless, long-term survival can be achieved in this group, and such treatment should be considered for carefully selected patients at an experienced center.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The size and importance of socioeconomic status (SES)-based disparities in use of surgery for non-advanced stage gastrointestinal (GI) cancers have not been quantified. METHODS: The exposure in this study of patients age 18-80 with one of nine non-advanced stage GI cancers in the 2007-2015 SEER database was a census tract-level SES composite. Multivariable models assessed associations of SES with use of surgery. Causal mediation analysis was used to estimate the proportion of survival disparities in SES quintiles 1 versus 5 that were mediated by disparities in use of surgery. RESULTS: Lowest SES quintile patients underwent surgery at significantly lower rates than highest quintile patients in each cancer. SES-based disparities in use of surgery were large and graded in esophagus adenocarcinoma, intrahepatic and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Smaller but clinically relevant disparities were present in stomach, ampulla, and small bowel adenocarcinoma, whereas disparities were small in colorectal adenocarcinoma. Five-year all-stage overall survival (OS) was correlated with the size of disparities in use of surgery in SES quintiles 1 versus 5 (r\,=\,-\,0.87; p\,=\,0.003). Mean OS was significantly longer (range 3.5-8.9~months) in SES quintile 5 versus 1. Approximately one third of SES-based survival disparities in poor prognosis GI cancers were mediated by disparities in use of surgery. The size of disparities in use of surgery in SES quintiles 1 versus 5 was correlated with the proportion mediated (r\,=\,0.98; p\,{$<$}\,0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Low SES patients with poor prognosis GI cancers are at substantial risk of undertreatment. Disparities in use of surgery contribute to diminished survival.},

No studies have been conducted regarding EN in patients after thoracoscopic esophagectomy as a less invasive surgery. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of EN after thoracoscopic esophagectomy. METHODS: Fifty patients who underwent thoracoscopic esophagectomy for esophageal cancer were divided into two groups: parenteral nutrition (PN; n = 25) and EN (n = 25). The rate of weight loss at postoperative day (POD) 14, levels of prealbumin at POD 10, postoperative complications until POD 14, and other perioperative data were collected for each group. RESULTS: This study analyzed data for 47 patients. The rate of weight loss at POD 14 was significantly lower in the EN group (3.0 {$\pm$} 3.2 \%) than in the PN group (5.1 {$\pm$} 3.7 \%; p = 0.020). Prealbumin levels were 21.0 {$\pm$} 7.5 mg/dL in the PN group and 18.4 {$\pm$} 5.8 mg/dL in the EN group at POD 10, with no significant differences between the groups. However, the incidence of postoperative pneumonia was higher in the PN group (30.4 \%) than in the EN group (12.5 \%). CONCLUSIONS: EN could suppress weight loss and reduce the incidence of pneumonia after thoracoscopic esophagectomy.},

  abstract = {Current algorithms for surveillance of patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) after chemoradiation and surgery (trimodality therapy [TMT]) remain empiric. The authors hypothesized that the frequency, type, and timing of relapses after TMT would be highly associated with surgical pathology stage (SPS), and therefore SPS could be used to individualize the surveillance strategy. Between 2000 and 2010, 518 patients with EAC were identified who underwent TMT at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and were frequently surveyed. Frequency, type, and timing of the first relapse (locoregional and/or distant) were tabulated according to SPS. Standard statistical approaches were used. The median follow-up time after esophageal surgery was 55.4 months (range, 1.0-149.2 months). Disease relapse occurred in 215 patients (41.5\%). Higher SPS was associated with a higher rate of relapse (0/I vs II/III, P{$\leq$}.001; 0/I vs II, P=.002; SPS 0/I vs III, P{$\leq$}.001; and SPS II vs III, P=.005) and with shorter time to relapse (P{$<$}.001). Irrespective of the SPS, approximately 95\% of all relapses occurred within 36 months of surgery. The 3- and 5-year overall survival rates were shorter for patients with a higher SPS than those with a lower SPS (0/I vs II/III, P{$\leq$}.001; 0/I vs II, P{$\leq$}.001; 0/I vs III, P{$\leq$}.001; and II vs III, P=.014). The compelling data show an excellent association between SPS and frequency/type/timing of relapses after TMT in patients with EAC. Thus, the surveillance strategy can potentially be customized based on SPS. These data can inform a future evidence-based surveillance strategy that can be efficient and cost-effective.},

However, after achieving a clinical complete response [clinCR; defined as both post-chemoradiation endoscopic biopsy showing no cancer and physiologic uptake by positron emission tomography (PET)], some patients decline surgery. The literature on the outcome of such patients is sparse. METHOD: Between 2002 and 2011, we identified 622 trimodality-eligible EC patients in our prospectively maintained databases. All patients had to be trimodality eligible and must have completed preoperative staging after chemoradiation that included repeat endoscopic biopsy and PET among other routine tests. RESULTS: Out of 622 trimodality-eligible patients identified, 61 patients (9.8\%) declined surgery. All 61 patients had a clinCR. The median age was 69 years (range 47-85). Males (85.2\%) and Caucasians (88.5\%) were dominant. Baseline stage was II (44.2\%) or III (52.5\%), and histology was adenocarcinoma (65.6\%) or squamous cell carcinoma (29.5\%). Forty-two patients are alive at a median follow-up of 50.9 months (95\% CI 39.5-62.3). The 5-year overall and relapse-free survival rates were 58.1 {$\pm$} 8.4 and 35.3 {$\pm$} 7.6\%, respectively. Of 13 patients with local recurrence during surveillance, 12 had successful salvage resection. CONCLUSION: Although the outcome of 61 EC patients with clinCR who declined surgery appears reasonable, in the absence of a validated prediction/prognosis model, surgery must be encouraged for all trimodality-eligible patients.},

Some patients, however, decline surgery after preoperative chemoradiation. The question of which patient should have esophagectomy and which one should not is unlikely to be answered by a prospective comparison; therefore, we matched the clinical covariates of several patients who had surgery with those who declined surgery (DS). METHODS: Between 2002 and 2011, we identified 623 patients in our databases. Of 623 patients, 244 patients had TMT and 61 TMT-eligible patients were in the DS group. Using the propensity-score method, we matched 16 covariates between 36 DS patients and 36 TMT patients. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics between the two groups were balanced (p = NS). The median overall survival times were: 57.9 months (95\% CI: 27.7 to not applicable, NA) for the DS group and 50.8 months (95\% CI: 30.7 to NA) for the TMT group (p = 0.28). The median relapse-free survival times were: 18.5 (95\% CI: 11.5-30.4) for the DS group and 26.5 months (95\% CI: 15.5-NA) for the TMT group (p = 0.45). Eleven (31\%) of 36 patients in the DS group had salvage surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Our results are intriguing but skewed by the patients who had salvage surgery in the DS group. Until highly reliable predictive models are developed for esophageal preservation, TMT must be encouraged for all TMT-eligible gastroesophageal cancer patients.},

METHODS: 200 consecutive patients who underwent resection for OC between 2006 and 2013 were selected. Preoperative CTs were used to assess markers of sarcopenia and body composition (total muscle area [TMA], fat-free mass index [FFMi], fat mass index [FMi], subcutaneous, visceral and retrorenal fat [RRF], muscle attenuation). Cox regression was used to assess the primary outcome parameter of overall survival (OS) after surgery. RESULTS: 130 patients (65\%) had sarcopenia based on preoperative CT examinations. Sarcopenic patients showed impaired survival compared to non-sarcopenic individuals (hazard ratio [HR] 1.87, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.15-3.03, p\,=\,0.011). Furthermore, low skeletal muscle attenuation (HR 1.91, 95\% CI 1.12-3.28, p\,=\,0.019) and increased FMi (HR 3.47, 95\% CI 1.27-9.50, p\,=\,0.016) were associated with impaired outcome. In the multivariate analysis, including a composite score (CSS) of those three parameters and clinical variables, only CSS, T-stage and surgical resection margin remained significant predictors of OS. CONCLUSION: Patients who show signs of sarcopenia and alterations in BCPs on preoperative CT images have impaired long-term outcome after surgery for OC. KEY POINTS: \textbullet{} Sarcopenia is associated with impaired OS after surgery for oesophageal cancer. \textbullet{} Other body composition parameters are also associated with impaired survival. \textbullet{} This influence on survival is independent of established clinical parameters. \textbullet{} Sarcopenia provides a better estimation of cachexia than BMI. \textbullet{} Sarcopenia assessment could be considered in risk/benefit stratification before oesophagectomy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with potentially curative oesophago-gastric cancer typically undergo neo-adjuvant chemotherapy prior to surgery. The majority of anti-cancer drugs have a narrow therapeutic index. The aim of this study was to determine if features of body composition, assessed using computed tomography (CT) scans, may be predictive of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in patients undergoing neo-adjuvant chemotherapy for oesophago-gastric cancer. The influence of sarcopenia and DLT on overall survival was also evaluated. METHODS: 89 Patients having potentially curative oesophago-gastric cancer surgery were studied. Patients studied had histologically confirmed oesophago-gastric cancer with no evidence of distant metastasis on pre-operative staging. CT scan was performed in all cases at diagnosis. DLT was defined as toxicity leading to postponement of treatment, a drug dose reduction or definitive interruption of drug administration. RESULTS: DLT occurred in 37 out of 89 patients (41.6\%) undergoing chemotherapy. Sarcopenia (odds ratio, 2.95; 95\% confidence interval, 1.23-7.09; p = 0.015) was associated with DLT on multivariate analysis. Median overall survival for patients who were sarcopenic was 569 days (IQ range: 357-1230 days) vs. 1013 days (IQ range: 496-1318 days) for patients who were not sarcopenic (p = 0.04). There was no significant difference in overall survival in patients who experienced DLT compared with those that did not (p = 0.665). CONCLUSIONS: Sarcopenia is a significant predictor of DLT in oesophago-gastric cancer patients undergoing neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. These results raise the potential for use of assessment of skeletal muscle mass using CT scans to predict toxicity and individualize chemotherapy dosing.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate if weight and body composition, specifically sarcopenia, assessed from diagnostic computed tomography (CT) scans, is of prognostic value in patients with pancreatic cancer. The nature and extent of tissue loss over subsequent months was also evaluated. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A total of 111 patients entering a palliative therapy program, who had CT images and had undergone nutritional screening, were studied. In patients for whom follow-up scans were available (n = 44), longitudinal changes in body composition were studied at a mean of 230 +/- 62 and 95 +/- 60 days prior to demise. RESULTS: Sixty-two patients (55.9\%) were sarcopenic, 44 (39.6\%) were overweight/obese, and 18 (16.2\%) were both. Age {$>$} or =59 years (hazard ratio, 1.71; 95\% confidence interval, 1.10-2.66; P = 0.018), and overweight/obese sarcopenia (hazard ratio, 2.07; 95\% confidence interval, 1.23-3.50; P = 0.006) were identified as independent predictors of survival on multivariate analysis. Longitudinal analysis revealed that total fat-free mass index decreased from 15.5 +/- 2.5 kg/m(2) to 14.5 +/- 2.0 kg/m2 (P = 0.002), and total fat mass index decreased from 7.5 +/- 2.0kg/m2 to 6.0 +/- 1.5kg/m2 (P {$<$} 0.0001) over 135 days. CONCLUSIONS: Sarcopenia in overweight/obese patients with advanced pancreatic cancer is an occult condition but can be identified using CT scans. This condition is an independent adverse prognostic indicator that should be considered for stratification of patients' entering clinical trials, systemic therapy, or support care programs.},

  abstract = {Para-aortic lymph node (PALN) recurrence is often seen in patients with lower thoracic esophageal cancer treated by esophagectomy with extended lymph node dissection. However, the clinicopathological characteristics of patients with PALN metastasis and the significance of PALN dissection are unknown. A total of 283 patients with lower thoracic esophageal cancer underwent esophagectomy with lymphadenectomy at our hospital between April 1984 and March 2007. Among these 283 patients, 60 patients were enrolled in this retrospective study according to following criteria: (i) clinical T2 to T4 tumor, (ii) no clinical PALN metastasis, and (iii) received PALN dissection. PALN dissection was indicated by a tumor depth of at least T2 and no severe complications. The clinicopathological data, recurrence pattern, and overall survival were compared between patients with PALN and without PALN metastasis. The mean length of surgery was 587 min and the mean blood loss was 1383 mL. The morbidity was 33.3\% and mortality was 5\% in this series. Sixteen patients (26.7\%) had PALN metastasis; these showed significantly more lymph node metastases (15.8 {$\pm$} 13.2 vs. 3.0 {$\pm$} 3.2, P {$<$} 0.0001) and significantly worse survival rates (53.3\% vs. 79.9\% at 1 year, 6.7\% vs. 62.0\% at 3 years, P {$<$} 0.0001) than patients without PALN metastasis. The incidence of lymph node recurrence (P {$<$} 0.0001) and hematogenous recurrence (P= 0.0487) was also higher in patients with PALN metastasis than in patients without PALN metastasis. Among the 16 patients with PALN metastasis, a univariate analysis revealed total number of metastatic nodes {$<$} 8 (P= 0.0325) to be a significant prognostic factor. A multivariate logistic regression analysis of the regional lymph nodes identified the invasion of the lower mediastinal nodes (hazard ratio = 6.120) and retroperitoneal nodes (hazard ratio = 15.167) to be significantly correlated with PALN metastasis. PALN metastasis is suggested to be related to the systemic spread of lymphatic metastasis even in lower thoracic esophageal cancer. PALN dissection for pathological PALN(+) patients should not be performed. It remains to be determined in future prospective studies whether patients without pathological PALN metastasis, but showing PALN micrometastasis, could achieve improved survival with PALN dissection.},

We frequently apply the Modified-ERAS program following oesophagectomy. This study aims to elucidate the impact of goal-directed fluid therapy (GDT) for the perioperative management of oesophageal cancer on the postoperative recovery of patients undergoing oesophagectomy. METHODS: This is an interventional before-after comparative observational study conducted at Kanagawa Cancer Centre, Japan. Patients who underwent elective oesophagectomy for oesophageal cancer were recruited. Group H (retrospectively collected) received intraoperative and postoperative management consisting of fluid administration without haemodynamic monitoring and the M-ERAS program, while Group S prospectively received management consisting of GDT and the M-ERAS program. The primary endpoint was the speed of gastrointestinal functional recovery, while secondary endpoints were the level of postoperative mobilisation, incidence of complications, postoperative length of hospital stay (LOS), and nutritional status after discharge. RESULTS: The proportion of patients who completely egested Gastrografin by postoperative day 4, the level of postoperative mobilisation, and achievement ratio for a 100-m walk on the first postoperative attempt were significantly higher in Group S than in Group H (P~=~0.034, P~=~0.0197, and P~{$<~$}0.0001, respectively). No significant differences were observed in the postoperative LOS and incidence of complications within 30 days between the groups. The serum albumin levels at 6 months after discharge was higher in Group S than in Group H (P~=~0.0002). CONCLUSIONS: The GDT-ERAS program enhanced postoperative gastrointestinal recovery and mobilisation, as well as postoperative nutritional status and protein synthesis. The program did not affect either postoperative LOS or the incidence of complications.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The prognostic relevance of preoperative high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessment of circumferential resection margin (CRM) involvement is unknown. This follow-up study of 374 patients with rectal cancer reports the relationship between preoperative MRI assessment of CRM staging, American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM stage, and clinical variables with overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and time to local recurrence (LR). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients underwent protocol high-resolution pelvic MRI. Tumor distance to the mesorectal fascia of {$\leq$} 1 mm was recorded as an MRI-involved CRM. A Cox proportional hazards model was used in multivariate analysis to determine the relationship of MRI assessment of CRM to survivorship after adjusting for preoperative covariates. RESULTS: Surviving patients were followed for a median of 62 months. The 5-year OS was 62.2\% in patients with MRI-clear CRM compared with 42.2\% in patients with MRI-involved CRM with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.97 (95\% CI, 1.27 to 3.04; P {$<$} .01). The 5-year DFS was 67.2\% (95\% CI, 61.4\% to 73\%) for MRI-clear CRM compared with 47.3\% (95\% CI, 33.7\% to 60.9\%) for MRI-involved CRM with an HR of 1.65 (95\% CI, 1.01 to 2.69; P {$<$} .05). Local recurrence HR for MRI-involved CRM was 3.50 (95\% CI, 1.53 to 8.00; P {$<$} .05). MRI-involved CRM was the only preoperative staging parameter that remained significant for OS, DFS, and LR on multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: High-resolution MRI preoperative assessment of CRM status is superior to AJCC TNM-based criteria for assessing risk of LR, DFS, and OS. Furthermore, MRI CRM involvement is significantly associated with distant metastatic disease; therefore, colorectal cancer teams could intensify treatment and follow-up accordingly to improve survival outcomes.},

Multiple software programs are available, but little work has been done comparing programs. We aimed to determine if CT-derived measures of skeletal muscle CSA at the level of the L3 are influenced by the software program used. We also demonstrate the importance of the ImageJ corrigendum published in this journal. METHODS: Two software programs, National Institutes of Health ImageJ and Tomovision sliceOmatic, were compared. ImageJ measures were obtained using both the original tutorial and corrigendum instructions. Skeletal muscle CSA at the level of the L3 was measured in advanced heart failure and head and neck cancer populations by 3 different investigators. Intraclass correlation coefficients were used to calculate intrarater and interrater reliability. Bland-Altman analysis was used to assess agreement. RESULTS: Both software programs yielded excellent intrarater and interrater reliability scores (intraclass correlation coefficients, 0.985-1.000). The overall mean difference (ImageJ tutorial with corrigendum - sliceOmatic) for the entire sample (N = 51) was found to be 1.53 cm2 (95\% CI, 0.59-2.47 cm2 ). The overall mean difference (ImageJ corrected - original) for the entire sample (N = 51) was found to be -11.35 cm2 (95\% CI, -12.75 to -9.95 cm2 ). CONCLUSION: Measures of skeletal muscle CSA at the L3 were found to be {$\sim$}1.53 cm2 higher with ImageJ than sliceOmatic. This difference was not found to affect interpretation against a published cut point. The importance of accounting for the ImageJ tutorial corrigendum was shown to be clinically significant when applied to published cut points.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: For endoscopic resection of early GI neoplasia, endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) achieves higher rates of complete resection (R0) than endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR). However, ESD is technically more difficult and evidence from randomised trial is missing. OBJECTIVE: We compared the efficacy and safety of ESD and EMR in patients with neoplastic Barrett's oesophagus (BO). DESIGN: BO patients with a focal lesion of high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (HGIN) or early adenocarcinoma (EAC) {$\leq$}3\hspace{0.25em}cm were randomised to either ESD or EMR. Primary outcome was R0 resection; secondary outcomes were complete remission from neoplasia, recurrences and adverse events (AEs). RESULTS: There were no significant differences in patient and lesion characteristics between the groups randomised to ESD (n=20) or EMR (n=20). Histology of the resected specimen showed HGIN or EAC in all but six cases. Although R0 resection defined as margins free of HGIN/EAC was achieved more frequently with ESD (10/17 vs 2/17, p=0.01), there was no difference in complete remission from neoplasia at 3\hspace{0.25em}months (ESD 15/16 vs EMR 16/17, p=1.0). During a mean follow-up period of 23.1{$\pm$}6.4\hspace{0.25em}months, recurrent EAC was observed in one case in the ESD group. Elective surgery was performed in four and three cases after ESD and EMR, respectively (p=1.0). Two severe AEs were recorded for ESD and none for EMR (p=0.49). CONCLUSIONS: In terms of need for surgery, neoplasia remission and recurrence, ESD and EMR are both highly effective for endoscopic resection of early BO neoplasia. ESD achieves a higher R0 resection rate, but for most BO patients this bears little clinical relevance. ESD is, however, more time consuming and may cause severe AE.

We conducted an economic evaluation of this initiative to not only determine its cost-effectiveness, but also to inform strategy for the spread and scale of ERAS to other surgical protocols and sites. METHODS: We assessed the impact of ERAS on patients\&\#8217; health services utilization (HSU; length of stay [LOS], readmissions, emergency department visits, general practitioner and specialist visits) within 30 days of discharge by comparing pre- and post-ERAS groups using multilevel negative binomial regressions. We estimated the net health care costs/savings and the return on investment (ROI) associated with those impacts for post-ERAS patients using a decision analytic modelling technique. RESULTS: We included 331 pre- and 1295 post-ERAS patients in our analyses. ERAS was associated with a reduction in all HSU outcomes except visits to specialists. However, only the reduction in primary LOS was significant. The net health system savings were estimated at \$2 290 000 (range \$1 191 000\&\#8211;\$3 391 000), or \$1768 (range \$920\&\#8211;\$2619) per patient. The probability for the program to be cost-saving was 73\%\&\#8211;83\%. In terms of ROI, every \$1 invested in ERAS would bring \$3.8 (range \$2.4\&\#8211;\$5.1) in return. CONCLUSION: The initial phase of ERAS implementation for colorectal surgery in Alberta is cost-saving. The total savings has the potential to be more substantial when ERAS is spread for other surgical protocols and across additional sites.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chromoendoscopy is traditionally used to identify inconspicuous Barrett's neoplasia and mark the boundaries before endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR). Trimodal imaging endoscopy is useful in identifying early neoplasia in Barrett's esophagus. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy (lateral and deep margin clearance) of trimodal imaging endoscopy-assisted EMR in early Barrett's neoplasia in a tertiary referral setting. METHODS: The entire Barrett's segment was visualized by high-resolution endoscopy followed by autofluorescence imaging, and suspicious areas were identified. Narrow band imaging and magnification was used to confirm the suspicious areas. The outer boundary of the lesion was then marked using the tip of a snare diathermy and EMR was performed using multiband mucosectomy technique by a single operator (KR). RESULTS: Sixteen patients were included: 13 patients had high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (HGIN); 3 patients had intramucosal carcinoma (IMC); (8 males, median age, 69.5 (range, 50-77) years with Barrett's esophagus (interquartile range (IQR), 2-5 cm; median length, 3 cm). All lesions were successfully identified, using trimodal imaging endoscopy. Overall EMR was complete in 14 of 16 (81.2\%) patients with early Barrett's neoplasia. Four of 16 patients (18\%; all with pre-EMR HGIN) were considered to have incomplete EMR (deep margins involved), but operative histology showed only Barrett's metaplasia in 2 (histological false positive) and IMC in 1. Thus, overall 14 of 16 (87.5\%) patients had complete EMR of the original lesions. In patients who did not undergo esophagectomy, there was no disease recurrence on endoscopic biopsies at a mean follow-up of 8 (IQR, 6-12) months. Three of the 16 patients (18.75\%) with post-EMR bleeding were successfully treated with APC/hemoclips. CONCLUSIONS: Trimodal imaging endoscopy is a feasible alternative to chromoendoscopy to identify inconspicuous neoplasia and assist EMR of early neoplasia in Barrett's esophagus.},

  abstract = {Progressive weight loss is a common feature of many types of cancer and is responsible not only for a poor quality of life and poor response to chemotherapy, but also a shorter survival time than is found in patients with comparable tumors without weight loss. Although anorexia is common, a decreased food intake alone is unable to account for the changes in body composition seen in cancer patients, and increasing nutrient intake is unable to reverse the wasting syndrome. Although energy expenditure is increased in some patients, cachexia can occur even with a normal energy expenditure. Various factors have been investigated as mediators of tissue wasting in cachexia. These include cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), as well as tumor-derived factors such as lipid mobilizing factor (LMF) and protein mobilizing factor (PMF), which can directly mobilize fatty acids and amino acids from adipose tissue and skeletal muscle respectively. Induction of lipolysis by the cytokines is thought to result from an inhibition of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), although clinical studies provide no evidence for an inhibition of LPL in the adipose tissue of cancer patients. Instead there is an increased expression of hormone sensitive lipase, the enzyme activated by LMF. Protein degradation in cachexia is associated with an increased activity of the ATP-ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The biological activity of both the LMF and PMF was shown to be attenuated by eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Clinical studies show that this polyunsaturated fatty acid is able to stabilize the rate of weight loss and adipose tissue and muscle mass in cachectic patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer. Knowledge of the mechanism of cancer cachexia should lead to the development of new therapeutic agents.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To prioritize research topics relevant to the care of the growing population of older adults with multiple chronic conditions (MCCs). DESIGN: Survey of experts in MCC practice, research, and policy. Topics were derived from white papers, funding announcements, or funded research projects relating to older adults with MCCs. SETTING: Survey conducted through the Health Care Systems Research Network (HCSRN) and Claude D. Pepper Older Americans Independence Centers (OAICs) Advancing Geriatrics Infrastructure and Network Growth Initiative, a joint endeavor of the HCSRN and OAICs. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals affiliated with the HCSRN or OAICs and national MCC experts, including individuals affiliated with funding agencies having MCC-related grant portfolios. MEASUREMENTS: A "top box" methodology was used, counting the number of respondents selecting the top response on a 5-point Likert scale and dividing by the total number of responses to calculate a top box percentage for each of 37 topics. RESULTS: The highest-ranked research topics relevant to the health and healthcare of older adults with MCCs were health-related quality of life in older adults with MCCs; development of assessment tools (to assess, e.g., symptom burden, quality of life, function); interactions between medications, disease processes, and health outcomes; disability; implementation of novel (and scalable) models of care; association between clusters of chronic conditions and clinical, financial, and social outcomes; role of caregivers; symptom burden; shared decision-making to enhance care planning; and tools to improve clinical decision-making. CONCLUSION: Study findings serve to inform the development of a comprehensive research agenda to address the challenges relating to the care of this "high-need, high-cost" population and the healthcare delivery systems responsible for serving it.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (ND-CKD) often receive an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) and oral iron treatment. This study evaluated whether a switch from oral iron to intravenous ferric carboxymaltose can reduce ESA requirements and improve iron status and hemoglobin in patients with ND-CKD. METHODS: This prospective, single arm and single-center study included adult patients with ND-CKD (creatinine clearance {$\leq$}40 mL/min), hemoglobin 11-12 g/dL and iron deficiency (ferritin {$<$}100 {$\mu$}g/L or transferrin saturation {$<$}20\%), who were regularly treated with oral iron and ESA during 6 months prior to inclusion. Study patients received an intravenous ferric carboxymaltose dose of 1,000 mg iron, followed by a 6-months ESA/ ferric carboxymaltose maintenance regimen (target: hemoglobin 12 g/dL, transferrin saturation {$>$}20\%). Outcome measures were ESA dose requirements during the observation period after initial ferric carboxymaltose treatment (primary endpoint); number of hospitalizations and transfusions, renal function before and after ferric carboxymaltose administration, number of adverse reactions (secondary endpoints). Hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, ferritin and transferrin saturation were measured monthly from baseline until end of study. Creatinine clearance, proteinuria, C-reactive protein, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase bimonthly from baseline until end of study. RESULTS: Thirty patients were enrolled (age 70.1{$\pm$}11.4 years; mean{$\pm$}SD). Mean ESA consumption was significantly reduced by 83.2{$\pm$}10.9\% (from 41,839{$\pm$}3,668 IU/patient to 6,879{$\pm$}4,271 IU/patient; p{$<$}0.01). Hemoglobin increased by 0.7{$\pm$}0.3 g/dL, ferritin by 196.0{$\pm$}38.7 {$\mu$}g/L and transferrin saturation by 5.3{$\pm$}2.9\% (month 6 vs. baseline; all p{$<$}0.01). No ferric carboxymaltose-related adverse events were reported and no patient withdrew or required transfusions during the study. CONCLUSION: Among patients with ND-CKD and stable normal or borderline hemoglobin, switching from oral iron to intravenous ferric carboxymaltose was associated with significant improvements in hematological and iron parameters and a significant reduction in ESA dose requirements in this single-center pilot study.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Survival outcome disparities among esophageal cancer patients exist, but are not fully understood. AIMS: We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database to determine whether survival differences among racial/ethnic patient populations persist after adjusting for demographic and clinical characteristics. METHODS: Our study included T1-3N0M0 adenocarcinoma and squamous cell cancer patients diagnosed between 2003 and 2011. We compared survival among two racial/ethnic patient subgroups using Cox proportional hazards methods, adjusting for age, sex, histology, marital status, socioeconomics, SEER region, comorbidities, T stage, tumor location, diagnosis year, and treatment received. RESULTS: Among 2025 patients, 87.9\% were White and 12.1\% were Nonwhite. Median survival was 18.7~months for Whites vs 13.8~months for Nonwhites (p\,=\,0.01). In the unadjusted model, Nonwhite patients had higher risk of mortality (HR\,=\,1.29, 95\% CI 1.11-1.49, p\,{$<$}\,0.0001) when compared to White patients; however, in the Cox regression adjusted model there was no significant difference (HR\,=\,0.94, 95\% CI 0.80-1.10, p\,=\,0.44). Surgery, chemotherapy, younger age, lower T stage, and lower Charlson comorbidity score were significant predictors in the full adjusted model. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in mortality risk by race/ethnicity appear to be largely explained by additional factors. In particular, associations were seen in surgery and T stage. Further research is needed to understand potential mechanisms underlying the differences and to better target patients who can benefit from treatment options.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: African Americans and Hispanics are reported to have higher mortality from esophageal cancer (EC) than Caucasians. In this study, we analyzed the independent effects of race, gender, treatment, and socioeconomic status (SES) on overall survival (OS). METHODS: Data for all EC cases between 2004 and 2010 with follow-up through 2012 were obtained from the California Cancer Registry. We conducted descriptive analyses of clinical variables and survival analyses by Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards methods. RESULTS: African Americans and Hispanics were more likely to be in the lower SES strata and less likely to receive surgery than Caucasians in this cohort. The proportion of patients receiving chemotherapy and radiotherapy was similar across different racial/ethnic groups. After adjustment for stage, grade, histology, treatments, and SES in multivariate analyses, the mortality risk in African Americans (hazard ratio [HR] 0.96, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.85-1.07) and Hispanics (HR 0.96, 95\% CI 0.89-1.07) did not differ from Caucasians (HR = 1.00, referent), with histology, SES, and surgery largely accounting for unadjusted OS differences. We also observed that African American men had higher adjusted risk of death relative to Caucasian men (HR 1.24, 95\% CI 1.07-1.42), but this effect was not observed for African American women compared to Caucasian women (HR 1.12, 95\% CI 0.94-1.35). CONCLUSIONS: Race is not an independent risk factor for OS in our population-based analysis of EC cases. Rather, observed differences in OS by race/ethnicity result from differences in cancer histology, SES, surgery, and gender. Our findings support further health disparities research for this disease.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIM: A gastric conduit is usually used to reconstruct the foregut after esophagectomy for cancer. The gastric emptying may be impaired after this operation, so some esophageal surgeons routinely add a pyloric drainage procedure (pyloroplasty or pyloromyotomy). We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to determine the effect of pyloric drainage on patient outcomes. METHODS: Medline and manual searches were done (completed independently and in duplicate) to identify all published RCTs that addressed the issue of pyloric drainage procedures during gastric conduit reconstruction of the esophagus. The selection process was inclusive; no trials were excluded. Trial validity assessment was done, and a trial quality score was assigned. Early outcomes assessed by meta-analysis included operative mortality, esophagogastric anastomotic leaks, pulmonary morbidity, pyloric drainage complications, fatal pulmonary aspiration, and gastric outlet obstruction. A random-effects model was used, and the relative risk was the principal measure of effect. Systematic semiquantitative review was used for late outcomes such as gastric emptying, bile reflux, nutritional status, and obstructive foregut symptoms. RESULTS: Nine RCTs, that included a total of 553 patients, were selected, with quality scores ranging from 1 to 4 (5-point Jadad scale). Selection and validity agreement was strong. The relative risk (95\% CI; p value), expressed as pyloric drainage versus no drainage (treatment vs. control), was 0.92 (0.34, 2.44; p = 0.86) for operative mortality, 0.90 (0.47, 1.76; p = 0.77) for esophagogastric anastomotic leaks, 0.69 (0.42, 1.14; p = 0.15) for pulmonary morbidity, 2.55 (0.34, 18.98; p = 0.36) for pyloric drainage complications, 0.25 (0.04, 1.60; p = 0.14) for fatal pulmonary aspiration, and 0.18 (0.03, 0.97; p = 0.046) for gastric outlet obstruction. Systematic semiquantitative review showed a nonsignificant trend favoring pyloric drainage for the late outcomes of gastric emptying, nutritional status, and obstructive foregut symptoms. For the late outcome of bile reflux, there was a nonsignificant trend favoring the no-drainage group. The scintographic gastric emptying time, expressed as a ratio (pyloric drainage/no drainage), was 0.53. CONCLUSIONS: Data synthesized from existing RCTs show that pyloric drainage procedures reduce the occurrence of early postoperative gastric outlet obstruction after esophagectomy with gastric reconstruction, but they have little effect on other early and late patient outcomes.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer death for both men and women, with an estimated 52\,980 persons in the US projected to die of colorectal cancer in 2021. Colorectal cancer is most frequently diagnosed among persons aged 65 to 74 years. It is estimated that 10.5\% of new colorectal cancer cases occur in persons younger than 50 years. Incidence of colorectal cancer (specifically adenocarcinoma) in adults aged 40 to 49 years has increased by almost 15\% from 2000-2002 to 2014-2016. In 2016, 26\% of eligible adults in the US had never been screened for colorectal cancer and in 2018, 31\% were not up to date with screening. OBJECTIVE: To update its 2016 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review to evaluate the benefits and harms of screening for colorectal cancer in adults 40 years or older. The review also examined whether these findings varied by age, sex, or race/ethnicity. In addition, as in 2016, the USPSTF commissioned a report from the Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network Colorectal Cancer Working Group to provide information from comparative modeling on how estimated life-years gained, colorectal cancer cases averted, and colorectal cancer deaths averted vary by different starting and stopping ages for various screening strategies. POPULATION: Asymptomatic adults 45 years or older at average risk of colorectal cancer (ie, no prior diagnosis of colorectal cancer, adenomatous polyps, or inflammatory bowel disease; no personal diagnosis or family history of known genetic disorders that predispose them to a high lifetime risk of colorectal cancer [such as Lynch syndrome or familial adenomatous polyposis]). EVIDENCE ASSESSMENT: The USPSTF concludes with high certainty that screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 50 to 75 years has substantial net benefit. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 45 to 49 years has moderate net benefit. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 76 to 85 years who have been previously screened has small net benefit. Adults who have never been screened for colorectal cancer are more likely to benefit. RECOMMENDATION: The USPSTF recommends screening for colorectal cancer in all adults aged 50 to 75 years. (A recommendation) The USPSTF recommends screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 45 to 49 years. (B recommendation) The USPSTF recommends that clinicians selectively offer screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 76 to 85 years. Evidence indicates that the net benefit of screening all persons in this age group is small. In determining whether this service is appropriate in individual cases, patients and clinicians should consider the patient's overall health, prior screening history, and preferences.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Palliation of malignant esophageal obstruction is an important clinical problem. Expandable metal stents are a major advance in therapy, but many stents become obstructed because of tumor ingrowth. The aim of this study was to compare a new, membrane-covered expandable metal stent to conventional prostheses in a randomized controlled trial. METHODS: Sixty-two patients with malignant inoperable esophageal obstruction at the gastroesophageal junction participated in the study. Patients were randomly assigned to covered or uncovered stents. The principal outcome measure was the need for reintervention because of recurrent dysphagia or migration. Secondary endpoints were relief of dysphagia measured by a dysphagia score (grade 0 = no dysphagia, grade 1 = able to eat solid food, grade 2 = semisolids only, grade 3 = liquids only, grade 4 = complete dysphagia) and the rate of complications and functional status. All patients were observed at monthly intervals until death or for 6 months. RESULTS: One week after stenting the dysphagia score improved significantly in both the uncovered (n = 32, 3 +/- 0.1 to 1 +/- 0.1 [means +/- SEMs], p {$<$} 0.001) and covered (n = 30, 3 +/- 0.1 to 1 +/- 0.2 [means +/- SEMs], p {$<$} 0.001) stents. Obstructing tumor ingrowth was significantly more likely in the uncovered stent group (9/30) than in the covered group (1/32) (p = 0.005). Significant stent migration occurred in 2/30 patients with uncovered stents, as compared with 4/32 patients in the covered group (p = 0.44). Reinterventions for tumor ingrowth were significantly greater in the uncovered stent group (27\%), as compared with 0\% in the covered group (p = 0.002). Life table analysis showed similar survival in both groups. CONCLUSION: Membrane-covered stents have significantly better palliation than conventional bare metal stents because of decreased rates of tumor ingrowth that necessitate endoscopic reintervention for dysphagia.},

  abstract = {Our purpose was to prospectively investigate optimal evaluation of qualitative and quantitative 18F-FDG PET/CT in response evaluations 12-14 wk after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) in esophageal cancer patients. Methods: This was a side study of the prospective diagnostic pre-SANO trial. 18F-FDG PET/CT scans at baseline and at 12-14 wk after nCRT were qualitatively assessed for the presence of tumor. Maximum SUVs normalized for lean body mass (SULmax) were measured in all scans. The primary endpoint was the proportion of false-negative patients with tumor regression grade (TRG) 3-4 ({$>$}10\% vital residual tumor) in qualitative and quantitative analyses. Receiver-operating-characteristic curve analysis for TRG1 versus TRG3-4 using SULmax, SULmax tumor-to-esophagus ratio, and {$\Delta\%$}SULmax was performed to define optimal cutoffs. Secondary endpoints were sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and positive predictive value for TRG1 versus TRG2-4. Results: In total, 129 of 219 patients were analyzed. Qualitative 18F-FDG PET/CT was unable to detect TRG3-4 in 15\% of patients. Sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and positive predictive value in qualitative analysis for detecting TRG1 versus TRG2-4 was 80\%, 37\%, 42\%, and 77\%, respectively. In 18 of 190 patients (10\%) with follow-up scans after nCRT, 18F-FDG PET/CT identified new interval metastases. Quantitative parameters did not detect TRG3-4 tumor in 27\%-61\% of patients. The optimal cutoff for detecting TRG1 versus TRG2-4 was a post-nCRT SULmax of 2.93 (area under receiver-operating-characteristic curve, 0.70). Conclusion: Qualitative and quantitative analyses of 18F-FDG PET/CT are unable to accurately detect TRG3-4 and to discriminate substantial residual disease from benign inflammation-induced 18F-FDG uptake after nCRT. However, 18F-FDG PET/CT is useful for the detection of interval metastases and might become useful in an active surveillance strategy with serial 18F-FDG PET/CT scanning.},

We hypothesize that increased muscle quantity is associated with better OS in patients with normal muscle radiodensity but not in patients with fatty degeneration of muscle tissue and low muscle radiodensity. We performed an observational cohort study in NSCLC patients treated with radiotherapy. A deep learning algorithm was used to measure muscle quantity as psoas muscle index (PMI) and psoas muscle radiodensity (PMD) on computed tomography. The potential interaction between PMI and PMD for OS was investigated using Cox proportional-hazards regression. Baseline adjustment variables were age, sex, histology, performance score and body mass index. We investigated non-linear effects of continuous variables and imputed missing values using multiple imputation. We included 2840 patients and observed 1975 deaths in 5903 patient years. The average age was 68.9 years (standard deviation 10.4, range 32 to 96) and 1692 patients (59.6\%) were male. PMI was more positively associated with OS for higher values of PMD (hazard ratio for interaction 0.915; 95\% confidence interval 0.861-0.972; p-value 0.004). We found evidence that high muscle quantity is associated with better OS when muscle radiodensity is higher, in a large cohort of NSCLC patients treated with radiotherapy. Future studies on the association between muscle status and OS should accommodate this interaction in their analysis for more accurate and more generalizable results.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Preoperative weight loss might increase the risk of postoperative morbidity and mortality after esophagectomy for cancer. We hypothesized that patients with esophageal cancer with {$>$}10\% weight loss during the 3 months before their diagnosis would be at an increased risk of postoperative complications, have a longer length of stay, and have worse overall survival. METHODS: In the present hospital-based cohort study, all patients who had undergone surgery for esophageal cancer in 1990 to 2010 at the Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam were included. Weight loss was defined as "no, or limited" ({$\leq$}10\%) or "severe" ({$>$}10\%). Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the relative risk of complications, expressed as odds ratios (ORs) with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). Hazard ratios were calculated to assess the length of hospital stay and survival. The risk estimates were adjusted for potential confounding factors. RESULTS: Of 922 included patients, 155 (17\%) had experienced severe weight loss. These patients had no increased risk of early surgical, early nonsurgical, or late surgical complications (OR, 0.83 and 95\% CI, 0.54-1.24; OR, 0.90 and 95\% CI, 0.63-1.30; OR, 1.14 and 95\% CI, 0.79-1.66, respectively) and had no increased length of stay (hazard ratio, 1.09; 95\% CI, 0.89-1.35). Preoperative weight loss was followed by increased 5-year mortality (hazard ratio, 1.34; 95\% CI, 1.02-1.74). CONCLUSIONS: A {$>$}10\% preoperative weight loss was followed by decreased 5-year survival after esophageal cancer surgery but no increased risk of postoperative complications.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) followed by total mesorectal excision is widely accepted as the standard of care for high-risk rectal cancer. Adjuvant chemotherapy is advised in several international guidelines, although the survival benefit remains unclear and compliance is poor. The current multidisciplinary approach has led to major improvements in local control, yet the occurrence of distant metastases has not decreased accordingly. The combination of short-course radiotherapy (SCRT) and chemotherapy in the waiting period before surgery might have several benefits, including higher compliance, downstaging and better effect of systemic therapy. METHODS: This is an investigator-initiated, international multicentre randomized phase III trial. High-risk rectal cancer patients were randomized to SCRT followed by chemotherapy (6 cycles CAPOX or alternatively 9 cycles FOLFOX4) and subsequent surgery, or long-course radiotherapy (25-28~\texttimes ~2-1.8~Gy) with concomitant capecitabine followed by surgery and optional postoperative chemotherapy (8 cycles CAPOX or 12 cycles FOLFOX4) according to local institutions' policy. The primary endpoint is time to disease-related treatment failure. Here, we report the compliance, toxicity and postoperative complications in both study groups. FINDINGS: Between June 2011 and June 2016, 920 patients were enrolled. Of these, 901 were evaluable (460 in the experimental arm and 441 in the standard arm). All patients in the experimental arm received 5~\texttimes ~5 Gy radiotherapy, and 84\% of all patients received at least 75\% of the prescribed chemotherapy. In the standard arm, the compliance for CRT was 93\% and 58\% for postoperative chemotherapy. Toxicity {$\geq$}grade 3 occurred in 48\% of patients in the experimental arm, compared to 25\% of patients in the standard arm during preoperative treatment and 35\% of patients during postoperative chemotherapy. No statistically significant differences in surgical procedures or postoperative complications were observed. INTERPRETATION: High compliance (84\%) of preoperative systemic treatment could be achieved with the experimental approach. Although considerable toxicity was observed during preoperative therapy, this did not lead to differences in surgical procedures or postoperative complications. Longer follow-up time is needed to assess the primary endpoint and related outcomes.},

  abstract = {Low skeletal muscle area (SMA) and muscle radiation attenuation (MRA) have been associated with poor prognosis in various patient populations. Both non-contrast and contrast CT scans are used to determine SMA and MRA. The effect of the use of a contrast agent on SMA and MRA is unknown. Therefore, we investigated agreement between these two scan options. SMA and MRA of 41 healthy individuals were analysed on a paired non-contrast and contrast single CT scan, and agreement between paired scan results was assessed with use of Bland-Altman plots, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), standard error of measurements (SEM) and smallest detectable differences at a 95\% confidence level (SDD95 ). Analyses were stratified by tube voltage. Difference in SMA between non-contrast and contrast scans made with a different tube voltage was 7{$\cdot$}0~{$\pm~$}7{$\cdot$}5~cm2 ; for scans made with the same tube voltage this was 2{$\cdot$}3~{$\pm~$}1{$\cdot$}7~cm2 . Agreement was excellent for both methods: ICC: 0{$\cdot$}952, SEM: 7{$\cdot$}2~cm2 , SDD95 : 19{$\cdot$}9~cm2 and ICC: 0{$\cdot$}997, SEM: 2{$\cdot$}0~cm2 , SDD95 : 5{$\cdot$}6~cm2 , respectively. MRA of scans made with a different tube voltage differed 1{$\cdot$}3~{$\pm~$}11{$\cdot$}3 HU, and agreement was poor (ICC: 0{$\cdot$}207, SEM: 7{$\cdot$}9 HU, SDD95 : 21{$\cdot$}8 HU). For scans made with the same tube voltage the difference was 6{$\cdot$}7~{$\pm~$}3{$\cdot$}2 HU, and agreement was good (ICC: 0{$\cdot$}682, SEM: 5{$\cdot$}3 HU, SDD95 : 14{$\cdot$}6 HU). In conclusion, SMA and MRA can be slightly influenced by the use of contrast agent. To minimise measurement error, image acquisition parameters of the scans should be similar.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Active surveillance after neoadjuvant therapies has emerged among several malignancies. During active surveillance, frequent assessments are performed to detect residual disease and surgery is only reserved for those patients in whom residual disease is proven or highly suspected without distant metastases. After neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT), nearly one-third of esophageal cancer patients achieve a pathologically complete response (pCR). Both patients that achieve a pCR and patients that harbor subclinical disseminated disease after nCRT could benefit from an active surveillance strategy. SUMMARY: Esophagectomy is still the cornerstone of treatment in patients with esophageal cancer. Non-surgical treatment via definitive chemoradiotherapy (dCRT) is currently reserved only for patients not eligible for esophagectomy. Since salvage esophagectomy after dCRT (50-60 Gy) results in increased complications, morbidity and mortality compared to surgery after nCRT (41.4 Gy), the latter seems preferable in the setting of active surveillance. Clinical response evaluations can detect substantial (i.e., tumor regression grade [TRG] 3-4) tumors after nCRT with a sensitivity of 90\%, minimizing the risk of development of non-resectable recurrences. Current scarce and retrospective literature suggests that active surveillance following nCRT might not jeopardize overall survival and postponed surgery could be performed safely. Key Message: Before an active surveillance approach could be considered standard treatment, results of phase III randomized trials should be awaited.},

In this study we investigated the impact of comorbidity and age on 30-, 60-, and 90-day mortality after resection of esophageal, gastric, periampullary, colon, and rectal cancer. METHODS: The study included 8,583 patients recorded in the population-based Netherlands Cancer Registry, regions Eindhoven (Eindhoven Cancer Registry) and Mid and South Limburg, who underwent resection for cancer stage I-III. Patients were diagnosed between 2005 and 2010. Age was categorized as {$<$}65, 65-74, and {$\geq$}75 years. RESULTS: Comorbidity was present in more than two-thirds (n = 5,910) of patients. The 30-day mortality rates ranged from 0.5 \% for rectal cancer patients {$<$}65 years to 12.8 \% for gastric cancer patients {$\geq$}75 years. Patients with comorbidity who underwent esophageal tumor resection had the highest mortality rates, ranging from 8.4 \% for 30-day to 12.0 \% for 90-day mortality, while rectal cancer patients had the lowest rates, that is, 4.3-6.4 \%, respectively. In multivariable analyses, cardiac disease (odds ratio [OR] = 1.74, 95 \% confidence interval [95 \% CI] = 1.32-2.30), vascular disease (OR = 1.41, 95 \% CI = 1.02-1.95) and previous malignancies (OR = 1.38, 95 \% CI = 1.02-1.86) in colon cancer, and cardiac disease (OR = 1.81, 95 \% CI = 1.10-2.98) and vascular disease (OR = 1.95, 95 \% CI = 1.11-3.42) in rectal cancer were associated with the highest 30-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative mortality extends beyond 30 days. Comorbidity and older age are associated with early postoperative mortality after gastrointestinal cancer resection. Underlying comorbidity should be identified preoperatively with attention to patients' specific needs to optimally attenuate risk prior to surgery. A less aggressive treatment approach may well be considered in these groups.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The TME trial investigated the value of preoperative short-term radiotherapy in combination with total mesorectal excision (TME). Long-term results are reported after a median follow-up of 12 years. METHODS: Between Jan 12, 1996, and Dec 31, 1999, 1861 patients with resectable rectal cancer without evidence of distant disease were randomly assigned to TME preceded by 5 \texttimes{} 5 Gy radiotherapy or TME alone (ratio 1:1). Randomisation was based on permuted blocks of six with stratification according to centre and expected type of surgery. The primary endpoint was local recurrence, analysed for all eligible patients who underwent a macroscopically complete local resection. FINDINGS: 10-year cumulative incidence of local recurrence was 5\% in the group assigned to radiotherapy and surgery and 11\% in the surgery-alone group (p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001). The effect of radiotherapy became stronger as the distance from the anal verge increased. However, when patients with a positive circumferential resection margin were excluded, the relation between distance from the anal verge and the effect of radiotherapy disappeared. Patients assigned to radiotherapy had a lower overall recurrence and when operated with a negative circumferential resection margin, cancer-specific survival was higher. Overall survival did not differ between groups. For patients with TNM stage III cancer with a negative circumferential resection margin, 10-year survival was 50\% in the preoperative radiotherapy group versus 40\% in the surgery-alone group (p=0{$\cdot$}032). INTERPRETATION: For all eligible patients, preoperative short-term radiotherapy reduced 10-year local recurrence by more than 50\% relative to surgery alone without an overall survival benefit. For patients with a negative resection margin, the effect of radiotherapy was irrespective of the distance from the anal verge and led to an improved cancer-specific survival, which was nullified by an increase in other causes of death, resulting in an equal overall survival. Nevertheless, preoperative short-term radiotherapy significantly improved 10-year survival in patients with a negative circumferential margin and TNM stage III. Future staging techniques should offer possibilities to select patient groups for which the balance between benefits and side-effects will result in sufficiently large gains.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The role of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in the treatment of patients with esophageal or esophagogastric-junction cancer is not well established. We compared chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery with surgery alone in this patient population. METHODS: We randomly assigned patients with resectable tumors to receive surgery alone or weekly administration of carboplatin (doses titrated to achieve an area under the curve of 2 mg per milliliter per minute) and paclitaxel (50 mg per square meter of body-surface area) for 5 weeks and concurrent radiotherapy (41.4 Gy in 23 fractions, 5 days per week), followed by surgery. RESULTS: From March 2004 through December 2008, we enrolled 368 patients, 366 of whom were included in the analysis: 275 (75\%) had adenocarcinoma, 84 (23\%) had squamous-cell carcinoma, and 7 (2\%) had large-cell undifferentiated carcinoma. Of the 366 patients, 178 were randomly assigned to chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery, and 188 to surgery alone. The most common major hematologic toxic effects in the chemoradiotherapy-surgery group were leukopenia (6\%) and neutropenia (2\%); the most common major nonhematologic toxic effects were anorexia (5\%) and fatigue (3\%). Complete resection with no tumor within 1 mm of the resection margins (R0) was achieved in 92\% of patients in the chemoradiotherapy-surgery group versus 69\% in the surgery group (P{$<$}0.001). A pathological complete response was achieved in 47 of 161 patients (29\%) who underwent resection after chemoradiotherapy. Postoperative complications were similar in the two treatment groups, and in-hospital mortality was 4\% in both. Median overall survival was 49.4 months in the chemoradiotherapy-surgery group versus 24.0 months in the surgery group. Overall survival was significantly better in the chemoradiotherapy-surgery group (hazard ratio, 0.657; 95\% confidence interval, 0.495 to 0.871; P=0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative chemoradiotherapy improved survival among patients with potentially curable esophageal or esophagogastric-junction cancer. The regimen was associated with acceptable adverse-event rates. (Funded by the Dutch Cancer Foundation [KWF Kankerbestrijding]; Netherlands Trial Register number, NTR487.).},

This systematic review aimed to collect the best available evidence on the effectiveness of preoperative iron supplementation with or without erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) on red blood cell (RBC) utilization in all-cause anaemic patients scheduled for elective surgery. Five databases and two trial registries were screened. Primary outcomes were the number of patients and the number of RBC units transfused. Effect estimates were synthesized by conducting meta-analyses. GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) was used to assess the certainty of evidence. We identified 29 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 2 non-RCTs comparing the effectiveness of preoperative iron monotherapy, or iron~+~ESAs, to control (no treatment, usual care, placebo). We found that: (1) IV and/or oral iron monotherapy may not result in a reduced number of units transfused and IV iron may not reduce the number of patients transfused (low-certainty evidence); (2) uncertainty exists whether the administration route of iron therapy (IV vs oral) differentially affects RBC utilization (very low-certainty evidence); (3) IV ferric carboxymaltose monotherapy may not result in a different number of patients transfused compared to IV iron sucrose monotherapy (low-certainty evidence); (4) oral iron~+~ESAs probably results in a reduced number of patients transfused and number of units transfused (moderate-certainty evidence); (5) IV iron~+~ESAs may result in a reduced number of patients transfused (low-certainty evidence); (6) oral and/or IV iron~+~ESAs probably results in a reduced number of RBC units transfused in transfused patients (moderate-certainty evidence); (7) uncertainty exists about the effect of oral and/or IV iron~+~ESAs on the number of patients requiring transfusion of multiple units (very low-certainty evidence). Effect estimates of different haematological parameters and length of stay were synthesized as secondary outcomes. In conclusion, in patients with anaemia of any cause scheduled for elective surgery, the preoperative administration of iron monotherapy may not result in a reduced number of patients or units transfused (low-certainty evidence). Iron supplementation in addition to ESAs probably results in a reduced RBC utilization (moderate-certainty evidence).},

So far no clinical parameters or diagnostic studies are able to accurately predict which patients will achieve a pathCR. The aim of this study was to determine whether subjective and quantitative assessment of baseline and postchemoradiation (18)F-FDG PET can improve the accuracy of predicting pathCR to preoperative chemoradiotherapy in esophageal cancer beyond clinical predictors. METHODS: This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board, and the need for written informed consent was waived. Clinical parameters along with subjective and quantitative parameters from baseline and postchemoradiation (18)F-FDG PET were derived from 217 esophageal adenocarcinoma patients who underwent chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery. The associations between these parameters and pathCR were studied in univariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis. Four prediction models were constructed and internally validated using bootstrapping to study the incremental predictive values of subjective assessment of (18)F-FDG PET, conventional quantitative metabolic features, and comprehensive (18)F-FDG PET texture/geometry features, respectively. The clinical benefit of (18)F-FDG PET was determined using decision-curve analysis. RESULTS: A pathCR was found in 59 (27\%) patients. A clinical prediction model (corrected c-index, 0.67) was improved by adding (18)F-FDG PET-based subjective assessment of response (corrected c-index, 0.72). This latter model was slightly improved by the addition of 1 conventional quantitative metabolic feature only (i.e., postchemoradiation total lesion glycolysis; corrected c-index, 0.73), and even more by subsequently adding 4 comprehensive (18)F-FDG PET texture/geometry features (corrected c-index, 0.77). However, at a decision threshold of 0.9 or higher, representing a clinically relevant predictive value for pathCR at which one may be willing to omit surgery, there was no clear incremental value. CONCLUSION: Subjective and quantitative assessment of (18)F-FDG PET provides statistical incremental value for predicting pathCR after preoperative chemoradiotherapy in esophageal cancer. However, the discriminatory improvement beyond clinical predictors does not translate into a clinically relevant benefit that could change decision making.},

  abstract = {The aim of the study was to compare the diagnostic performance of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), computed tomography (CT), and 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in staging of oesophageal cancer. PubMed was searched to identify English-language articles published before January 2006 and reporting on diagnostic performance of EUS, CT, and/or FDG-PET in oesophageal cancer patients. Articles were included if absolute numbers of true-positive, false-negative, false-positive, and true-negative test results were available or derivable for regional, celiac, and abdominal lymph node metastases and/or distant metastases. Sensitivities and specificities were pooled using a random effects model. Summary receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to study potential effects of study and patient characteristics. Random effects pooled sensitivities of EUS, CT, and FDG-PET for regional lymph node metastases were 0.80 (95\% confidence interval 0.75-0.84), 0.50 (0.41-0.60), and 0.57 (0.43-0.70), respectively, and specificities were 0.70 (0.65-0.75), 0.83 (0.77-0.89), and 0.85 (0.76-0.95), respectively. Diagnostic performance did not differ significantly across these tests. For detection of celiac lymph node metastases by EUS, sensitivity and specificity were 0.85 (0.72-0.99) and 0.96 (0.92-1.00), respectively. For abdominal lymph node metastases by CT, these values were 0.42 (0.29-0.54) and 0.93 (0.86-1.00), respectively. For distant metastases, sensitivity and specificity were 0.71 (0.62-0.79) and 0.93 (0.89-0.97) for FDG-PET and 0.52 (0.33-0.71) and 0.91 (0.86-0.96) for CT, respectively. Diagnostic performance of FDG-PET for distant metastases was significantly higher than that of CT, which was not significantly affected by study and patient characteristics. The results suggest that EUS, CT, and FDG-PET each play a distinctive role in the detection of metastases in oesophageal cancer patients. For the detection of regional lymph node metastases, EUS is most sensitive, whereas CT and FDG-PET are more specific tests. For the evaluation of distant metastases, FDG-PET has probably a higher sensitivity than CT. Its combined use could however be of clinical value, with FDG-PET detecting possible metastases and CT confirming or excluding their presence and precisely determining the location(s).},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Low skeletal muscle mass and density have recently been discovered as prognostic and predictive parameters to guide interventions in various populations, including cancer patients. The gold standard for body composition analysis in cancer patients is computed tomography (CT). To date, the effect of contrast-enhancement on muscle composition measurements has not been established. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of contrast-enhancement on skeletal muscle mass and density measurements on four-phase CT studies. DESIGN: In this observational study, two observers measured cross-sectional skeletal muscle area corrected for patients' height (skeletal muscle index [SMI]) and density (SMD) at the level of the third lumbar vertebra on 50 randomly selected CT examinations with unenhanced, arterial, and portal-venous phases. The levels of agreement between enhancement phases for SMI and SMD were calculated using intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs). RESULTS: Mean SMI was 42.5 ({$\pm$}9.9)~cm2/m2 on the unenhanced phase, compared with 42.8 ({$\pm$}9.9) and 43.6 ({$\pm$}9.9)~cm2/m2 for the arterial and portal-venous phase, respectively (both p~{$<~$}0.01). Mean SMD was lower for the unenhanced phase (30.9~{$\pm~$}8.0~Hounsfield units [HU]) compared with the arterial (38.0~{$\pm~$}9.9~HU) and portal-venous (38.7~{$\pm~$}9.2~HU) phase (both p~{$<~$}0.001). No significant difference was found between SMD in the portal-venous and arterial phase (p~=~0.161). The ICCs were excellent ({$\geq$}0.992) for all SMIs and for SMD between the contrast-enhanced phases (0.949). The ICCs for the unenhanced phase compared with the arterial (0.676) and portal-venous (0.665) phase were considered fair to good. CONCLUSIONS: Statistically significant differences in SMI were observed between different enhancement phases. However, further work is needed to assess the clinical relevance of these small differences. Contrast-enhancement strongly influenced SMD values. Studies using this measure should therefore use the portal-venous phase of contrast-enhanced CT examinations.},

  abstract = {The terminology used for describing intervention groups in randomised controlled trials (RCT) on the effect of intravenous fluid on outcome in abdominal surgery has been imprecise, and the lack of standardised definitions of the terms 'standard', 'restricted' and 'liberal' has led to some confusion and difficulty in interpreting the literature. The aims of this paper were to clarify these definitions and to use them to perform a meta-analysis of nine RCT on primarily crystalloid-based peri-operative intravenous fluid therapy in 801 patients undergoing elective open abdominal surgery. Patients who received more or less fluids than those who received a 'balanced' amount were considered to be in a state of 'fluid imbalance'. When 'restricted' fluid regimens were compared with 'standard or liberal' fluid regimens, there was no difference in post-operative complication rates (risk ratio 0.83 (95\% CI 0.49, 1.39, P = 0.47) [corrected] or length of hospital stay (weighted mean difference (WMD) - 1.77 (95\% CI - 4.36, 0.81) d, P = 0.18). However, when the fluid regimens were reclassified and patients were grouped into those who were managed in a state of fluid 'balance' or 'imbalance', the former group had significantly fewer complications (risk ratio 0{$\cdot$}59 (95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}44, 0{$\cdot$}81), P=0{$\cdot$}0008) and a shorter length of stay (WMD -3{$\cdot$}44 (95\% CI -6{$\cdot$}33, -0{$\cdot$}54) d, P=0{$\cdot$}02) than the latter. Using imprecise terminology, there was no apparent difference between the effects of fluid-restricted and standard or liberal fluid regimens on outcome in patients undergoing elective open abdominal surgery. However, patients managed in a state of fluid balance fared better than those managed in a state of fluid imbalance.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Please see Appendix 4 for a glossary of terms.The outcome of patients with esophageal cancer is generally poor. Although multimodal therapy is standard, there is conflicting evidence regarding the addition of esophagectomy to chemoradiotherapy. OBJECTIVES: To compare the effectiveness and safety of chemoradiotherapy plus surgery with that of chemoradiotherapy alone in people with nonmetastatic esophageal carcinoma. SEARCH METHODS: We performed a computerized search for relevant studies, up to Feburary 2017, on the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase databases using MeSH headings and keywords. We searched five online databases of clinical trials, handsearched conference proceedings, and screened reference lists of retrieved papers. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing chemoradiotherapy plus esophagectomy with chemoradiotherapy alone for localized esophageal carcinoma. We excluded RCTs comparing chemotherapy or radiotherapy alone with esophagectomy. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and the quality of the evidence, using standardized Cochrane methodological procedures. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS), estimated with Hazard Ratio (HR). Secondary outcomes, estimated with risk ratio (RR), were local and distant progression-free survival (PFS), quality of life (QoL), treatment-related mortality and morbidity, and use of salvage procedures for dysphagia. Data were analyzed using a random effects model in Review Manager 5.3 software. MAIN RESULTS: From 2667 references, we identified two randomized studies, in six reports, that included 431 participants. All participants were clinically staged to have at least T3 and/or node positive thoracic esophageal carcinoma, 93\% of which was squamous cell histology. The risk of methodological bias of the included studies was low to moderate.High-quality evidence found the addition of esophagectomy had little or no difference on overall survival (HR 0.99, 95\% CI 0.79 to 1.24; P = 0.92; I{$^2$} = 0\%; two trials). Neither study reported PFS, therefore, freedom from loco-regional relapse was used as a proxy. Moderate-quality evidence suggested that the addition of esophagectomy probably improved freedom from locoregional relapse (HR 0.55, 95\% CI 0.39 to 0.76; P = 0.0004; I{$^2$} = 0\%; two trials), but low-quality evidence suggested it may increase the risk of treatment-related mortality (RR 5.11, 95\% CI 1.74 to 15.02; P = 0.003; I{$^2$} = 2\%; two trials).The other pre-specified outcomes (quality of life, treatment-related toxicity, and use of salvage procedures for dysphagia) were reported by only one study, which found very low-quality evidence that use of esophagectomy was associated with reduced short-term QoL (MD 0.93, 95\% CI 0.24 to 1.62), and low-quality evidence that it reduced use of salvage procedures for dysphagia (HR 0.52, 95\% CI 0.36 to 0.75). Neither study compared treatment-related morbidity between treatment groups. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Based on the available evidence, the addition of esophagectomy to chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, provides little or no difference on overall survival, and may be associated with higher treatment-related mortality. The addition of esophagectomy probably delays locoregional relapse, however, this end point was not well defined in the included studies. It is undetermined whether these results can be applied to the treatment of adenocarcinomas, tumors involving the distal esophagus and gastro-esophageal junction, and to people with poor response to chemoradiation.},

We present an overview of existing tools to estimate life expectancy, as well as practical examples of how to take into account the patient's noncancer-specific life expectancy when discussing screening decisions, initiation of treatment, and end-of-life care. RECENT FINDINGS: Life expectancy prognostication has been recently recommended by international societies as part of the initial assessment of all older adults with cancer. Additionally, online resources have been created in order to make life expectancy calculation tools accessible for clinicians. Understanding available methods to estimate life expectancy, as well as how to utilize them, is a fundamental part of geriatric oncology that should be integrated into everyday clinical practice.},

METHODS: We reexamined the cases of 220 consecutive patients who underwent an Ivor Lewis esophagogastrectomy for esophageal cancer from January 1992 through December 1995. RESULTS: There were 196 men (89.1\%) and 24 women. Median age was 65 years (range, 29 to 85 years). The results of pathological study showed adenocarcinoma in 188 patients (85.5\%), squamous cell carcinoma in 31 (14.1\%), and leiomyosarcoma in 1 patient (0.5\%). Postsurgical staging was as follows: stage 0 in 10 patients, stage I in 19, stage IIa in 38, stage IIb in 28, stage III in 111, and stage IV in 14. The operative mortality rate was 1.4\% (3 patients), and complications occurred in 83 patients (37.7\%). Follow-up was 98.6\% complete. Median survival for operative survivors was 1.9 years (range, 32 days to 8.7 years). The overall 5-year survival rate was 25.2\%; it was 80\% for patients in stage 0, 94.4\% for those in stage I, 36.0\% for those in stage IIa, 14.3\% for patients in stage IIb, 10\% for those in stage III and 0\% for patients in stage IV. CONCLUSIONS: Ivor Lewis esophagogastrectomy for esophageal cancer is a safe operation. Long-term survival is stage dependent. The low survival associated with advanced cancers should stimulate the search for effective neoadjuvant therapy.},

This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to determine the best pain management modality focusing on the balance between benefits and risks. Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane library were systematically searched to identify all studies investigating different pain management modalities after esophagectomy in relation to primary outcomes (postoperative pain scores at 24 and 48 hours, technical failure, and opioid consumption), and secondary outcomes (pulmonary complications, nausea and vomiting, hypotension, urinary retention, and length of hospital stay). Ten studies investigating systemic, epidural, intrathecal, intrapleural and paravertebral analgesia involving 891 patients following esophagectomy were included. No significant differences were found in postoperative pain scores between systemic and epidural analgesia at 24 (mean difference (MD) 0.89; 95\% confidence interval (CI) -0.47-2.24) and 48 hours (MD 0.15; 95\%CI -0.60-0.91), nor described for systemic and other regional analgesia. Also, no significant differences in pulmonary complication rates were identified between systemic and epidural analgesia (relative risk (RR) 1.69; 95\%CI 0.86-3.29), or between systemic and paravertebral analgesia (RR 1.49; 95\%CI 0.31-7.12). Technical failure ranged from 17\% to 22\% for epidural analgesia. Sample sizes were too small to draw inferences on opioid consumption, the risk of nausea and vomiting, hypotension, urinary retention, and length of hospital stay when comparing the different pain management modalities including systemic, epidural, intrathecal, intrapleural, and paravertebral analgesia. This systematic review and meta-analysis shows no differences in postoperative pain scores or pulmonary complications after esophagectomy between systemic and epidural analgesia, and between systemic and paravertebral analgesia. Further randomized controlled trails are warranted to determine the optimal pain management modality after esophagectomy.},

Evidence of survival advantage of TMT over organ-preserving definitive chemoradiotherapy (dCRT) is inconclusive. The aim of this study is to compare survival between TMT and dCRT. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analyses were conducted. Randomised controlled trials and observational studies on resectable, curatively treated, oesophageal carcinoma patients above 18~years were included. Three online databases were searched for studies comparing TMT with dCRT. Primary outcomes were 1-, 2-, 3- and 5-year overall survival rates. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tools for RCTs and cohort studies. Quality of evidence was evaluated according to Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation. RESULTS: Thirty-two studies described in 35 articles were included in this systematic review, and 33 were included in the meta-analyses. Two-, three- and five-year overall survival was significantly lower in dCRT compared to TMT, with relative risks (RRs) of 0.69 (95\% CI 0.57-0.83), 0.76 (95\% CI 0.63-0.92) and 0.57 (95\% CI 0.47-0.71), respectively. When only analysing studies with equal patient groups at baseline, no significant differences for 2-, 3- and 5-year overall survival were found with RRs of 0.83 (95\% CI 0.62-1.10), 0.81 (95\% CI 0.57-1.14) and 0.63 (95\% CI 0.36-1.12). CONCLUSION: These meta-analyses do not show clear survival advantage for TMT over dCRT. Only a non-significant trend towards better survival was seen, assuming comparable patient groups at baseline. Non-operative management of oesophageal carcinoma patients might be part of a personalised and tailored treatment approach in future. However, to date hard evidence proving its non-inferiority compared to operative management is lacking.},

Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET) scanning can be used, but limited data exists regarding the use of combined PET/CT fusion imaging and EUS in ECA staging. The objective of this study is to evaluate the role of integrated PET/CT imaging and EUS in the staging of ECA. PROCEDURES: Identification of patients diagnosed with ECA from 2004 to 2007 that underwent staging PET/CT and EUS. Data regarding tumor detection, lymph node identification, presence of metastatic disease, and affect on patient management were collected and compared between PET/CT and EUS. RESULTS: Eighty-one patients (65 male, 16 female) were identified with mean age of 63.5 years who underwent EUS and PET/CT to stage known ECA. PET/CT identified the primary tumor in 74/81 (91.4\%) of cases, compared to 81/81 (100\%) with EUS. Locoregional adenopathy was seen by PET/CT in 29/81 (35.8\%) of cases, compared to 49/81 (60.5\%) by EUS (p = 0.0001). PET/CT identified celiac axis adenopathy in 8/81 (9.9\%) of cases, compared to 11/81 (13.6\%) with EUS (p = 0.5050). PET/CT identified 17/81 (21.0\%) of patients with distant metastases who subsequently did not undergo attempt at curative surgical resection. CONCLUSIONS: In ECA, EUS is superior to PET/CT for T staging and in identifying locoregional nodes, while PET/CT provides M staging. EUS and integrated PET/CT appear to independently affect treatment decisions, indicating complimentary and necessary roles in the staging of ECA.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study investigated the risk factors for severe weight loss (SWL) within one year after minimally invasive McKeown esophagectomy. METHODS: Esophageal cancer patients who underwent McKeown esophagectomy between January and July 2017 were prospectively enrolled. Preoperative body weight (PBW) was chosen as the initial body weight. RESULTS: Forty-four patients were enrolled and successfully followed up for one year. Median weight loss was 7.4\% (quartile: 5.3-8.1\%) and 12.6\% (quartile: 8.8-17.7\%) four weeks and one year after surgery, respectively. Accelerated weight loss occurred during the first two weeks after discharge, with median weight loss of 5.6\% (quartile: 4.2-7.1\%). Multivariable analysis showed that age {$\geq$} 70 years (odds ratio [OR] 7.65; P = 0.030), preoperative sarcopenia (OR 7.18; P = 0.030), the first surgery in the daily schedule (OR 6.87; P = 0.032) and vocal cord paralysis (OR 12.30; P = 0.046) were independent risk factors for short-term (4 weeks) SWL ({$>$} 7.5\% PBW), while an American Society of Anesthesiologists score of 3-4 (OR 6.58; P = 0.047), a high fat-free mass (OR 21.91; P = 0.003), and vocal cord paralysis (OR 25.83; P = 0.017) were independent risk factors for long-term (1 year) SWL ({$>$} 13.0\% PBW) after esophagectomy. Postoperative symptoms of insomnia, appetite loss, dysphagia, eating difficulties, and taste issues were also related to SWL. CONCLUSIONS: In esophageal cancer patients who have undergone esophagectomy, the first two weeks after hospital discharge is a key period for nutrition intervention. Patients with associated factors for SWL require postoperative nutrition support.},

We conducted a meta-analysis to clarify the relationship between myosteatosis and the overall survival of digestive cancer patients. The systematic literature search was conducted on PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Embase from inception through March 27, 2021. Meta-analysis was performed using the random-effects model. Out of 3451 studies screened, 47 studies including 21,194 patients passed the screening criteria. The average prevalence of myosteatosis was 46.4\%. Patients with myosteatosis had 44\% increased mortality risk compared with non-myosteatosis patients (HR: 1.44, 95\% CI: 1.33-1.55, P {$<$} .05). The predictive value of myosteatosis held regardless of country zone, study design, statistical model, Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) scores, treatment, sample size, and tumor stage. Nevertheless, the predictive value of myosteatosis was only evident for patients with esophagogastric cancers, cholangiocarcinoma/pancreatic cancers, or colorectal cancers. Overall, the results of this meta-analysis were robust based on sensitivity, subgroup, meta-regression, and trial sequential analyses and suggested that myosteatosis predicted worse overall survival (OS) in digestive malignancies patients.},

METHODS: Patients with SCC who underwent curative treatment from 2008 to 2014 were identified from the Taiwan Cancer Registry. Propensity score matching was undertaken to balance pretreatment clinical variables. Overall survival was compared between patients undergoing CRT-S or dCRT. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to identify prognostic factors for overall survival. RESULTS: A total of 5832 patients with clinical stage II and III oesophageal SCC receiving CRT-S (1754) or dCRT (4078) were included. After propensity score matching, each group included 1661 patients. The 3-year overall survival rate for patients treated with CRT-S was 41{$\cdot$}1 per cent compared with 17{$\cdot$}9 per cent for those who had dCRT (P {$<$} 0{$\cdot$}001). In multivariable analysis, treatment modality was an independent prognostic factor in the overall cohort before propensity score matching: hazard ratio 0{$\cdot$}45 (95 per cent c.i. 0{$\cdot$}40 to 0{$\cdot$}51) for CRT-S versus dCRT (P {$<$} 0{$\cdot$}001). In separate analyses of patients with clinical stage II and those with stage III disease, CRT-S was associated with significantly better overall survival than dCRT.

  abstract = {Objectives There is increasing evidence that muscle volume and mass are poor predictors of muscle strength and physical performance. Other assessments of muscle quality such as skeletal muscle density measured by computed tomography (CT) may be more important. The aim of this study was to explore associations of muscle size and density with handgrip strength (HGS) and the Timed Up and Go test (TUG). We also hypothesized that the strength of these associations would depend on the specific muscle of muscle group, namely trunk, hip, and mid-thigh muscles. Design Cross-sectional study. Setting and Participants University hospital; 316 volunteers aged 59 to 85~years. Methods HGS, TUG, and quantitative CT imaging of the lumber, hip, and mid-thigh were performed in volunteers. From the CT images, cross-sectional area and attenuation were determined for the gluteus muscle, trunk muscle at vertebrae L2 level, and mid-thigh muscle. Results In men and women, associations of muscle area with TUG were insignificant after adjustment for age, height, and weight. Associations with HGS were only significant in men for the gluteus maximus and the mid-thigh but slopes were rather low ({$\beta~<~$}0.20). Associations between muscle density and TUG/HGS were more pronounced, in particular for HGS. After adjustment, associations with TUG were significant in women for the gluteus maximus and trunk muscle even ({$\beta~-$}0.06, P .001 and {$\beta~-$}0.07, P .031, respectively). Conclusions and Implications Muscle density is more strongly associated with muscle strength than muscle size andin women muscle density was also more strongly associated than muscle size with physical performance. Therefore, muscle density may represent a more clinically meaningful surrogate of muscle performance than muscle size. Muscle density measurements of trunk and gluteus muscles can be easily obtained from routine CT scan and, therefore, may become an important measurement to diagnose and screen for sarcopenia.},

However, in esophagectomy the routine use of nasogastric decompression is still a matter of debate. To determine the effects of routine nasogastric decompression following esophagectomy compared with early or peroperative removal of the nasogastric tube on pulmonary complications, anastomotic leakage, mortality, and postoperative recovery. A systematic literature review and meta-analysis of studies comparing early or peroperative versus late removal of nasogastric tubes. A total of seven comparative studies were included (n\,=\,608). In two randomized trials, and one retrospective cohort study, peroperative removal of the nasogastric tube was compared with routine nasogastric decompression. In one randomized trial early removal of the nasogastric tube (on postoperative day 2) was compared with removal of the nasogastric tube on the 6th-10th postoperative day. In the remaining three trials a fast-track protocol without a nasogastric tube was compared with conventional care with a nasogastric tube during the first postoperative days. Peroperative or early removal of the nasogastric tube did not result in a significantly different rate of anastomotic leakage, pulmonary complications or mortality in individual studies, nor in the meta-analysis. In the meta-analysis, hospital stay was significantly shorter with peroperative or early removal of the nasogastric tube when all studies were included, but not when the meta-analysis was limited to randomized trials. This systematic review did not find a difference in adverse outcomes between nasogastric decompression or no nasogastric decompression following esophagectomy.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Esophageal and gastric cancer have a poor prognosis and surgical intervention is associated with considerable morbidity, highlighting the need for careful preoperative assessment. The Incremental Shuttle Walk Test (ISWT) and Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) can assess preoperative fitness. This study aims to investigate their correlation with both postoperative respiratory complications and overall survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were identified who underwent esophageal or gastric resections for cancer between 2010 and 2014 and had ISWT and/or CPET assessments. Tumor differentiation, stage, postoperative respiratory complications, and outcome were documented and then correlated with the results of the preoperative fitness assessments. RESULTS: Neither the ISWT result, anaerobic threshold (AT) nor VO2 Max correlated well with perioperative complications. However, ISWT (p~{$<~$}0.001), AT (p~{$<~$}0.001) and VO2 Max (p~{$<~$}0.001) all correlated strongly with overall survival. No patient with a score of less than 350~m on ISWT survived beyond 3 years. In a subset of patients with ISWT results both pre and post chemotherapy (n~=~49), those that had an improvement in result had a 19\% incidence of post-operative respiratory complications compared to 45\% where the result did not change or declined, though due to small numbers this only approached significance (p~=~0.08). CONCLUSION: ISWT and CPET can be useful preoperative tools to predict overall survival for patients undergoing esophago-gastric resection. Furthermore, patients that improve their functional status during chemotherapy seem to do better than those where it remains static or declines.},

  abstract = {Importance: Although optimal access is accepted as the key to quality care, an accepted methodology to ascertain potential disparities in surgical access has not been defined. Objective: To develop a systematic approach to detect surgical access disparities. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study used publicly available data from the Health Cost and Utilization Project State Inpatient Database from 2016. Using the surgical rate observed in the 5 highest-ranked counties (HRCs), the expected surgical rate in the 5 lowest-ranked counties (LRCs) in North Carolina were calculated. Patients 18 years and older who underwent an inpatient general surgery procedure and patients who underwent emergency inpatient cholecystectomy, herniorrhaphy, or bariatric surgery in 2016 were included. Data were collected from January to December 2016, and data were analyzed from March to July 2020. Exposures: Health outcome county rank as defined by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the proportional surgical ratio (PSR), which was the disparity in surgical access defined as the observed number of surgical procedures in the 5 LRCs relative to the expected number of procedures using the 5 HRCs as the standardized reference population. Results: In 2016, approximately 1.9 million adults lived in the 5 HRCs, while approximately 246\,854 lived in the 5 LRCs. A total of 28\,924 inpatient general surgical procedures were performed, with 4521 being performed in those living in the 5 LRCs and 24\,403 in those living in the 5 HRCs. The rate of general surgery in the 5 HRCs was 13.09 procedures per 1000 population. Using the 5 HRCs as the reference, the PSR for the 5 LRCs was 1.40 (95\% CI, 1.35-1.44). For emergent/urgent cholecystectomy, the PSR for the 5 LRCs was 2.26 (95\% CI, 2.02-2.51), and the PSR for emergent/urgent herniorrhaphy was 1.83 (95\% CI, 1.33-2.45). Age-adjusted rate of obesity (body mass index [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared] greater than 30), on average, was 36.6\% (SD, 3.4) in the 5 LRCs vs 25.4\% (SD, 4.6) in the 5 HRCs (P\,=\,.002). The rate of bariatric surgery in the 5 HRCs was 33.07 per 10\,000 population with obesity. For the 5 LRCs, the PSR was 0.60 (95\% CI, 0.51-0.69). Conclusions and Relevance: The PSR is a systematic approach to define potential disparities in surgical access and should be useful for identifying, investigating, and monitoring interventions intended to mitigate disparities in surgical access that effects the health of vulnerable populations.},

Patients with poor performance status (PS) were excluded from clinical trials, yet use of anti-PD1 is widespread in clinical practice. Literature regarding clinical and palliative care outcomes in patients with poor PS treated with anti-PD1 is lacking. METHODS: Retrospective review of outcomes for all patients with advanced melanoma treated with anti-PD1 between 2012 and June 2015 at Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, a tertiary specialist cancer center in Australia. RESULTS: Between 2012 and 2015, 91 patients received anti-PD1: median age 63, 65\% males, 77\% elevated LDH{$>$}1xULN (37/48 patients). Fifty-eight patients had baseline ECOG PS of 0-1 (64\%), 24 patients ECOG PS 2-3 (26\%) and ECOG PS was not recorded in nine patients (10\%). Median overall survival (OS) for the ECOG PS 0-1 group was 19.5 months and 1.8 months for ECOG PS 2-3 (HR 5.5; 95\% CI, 9.1-50.3; P = 0.0001). Tumor response was 23/58 (39\%) in ECOG PS 0-1, 2/16 (12\%) in ECOG PS 2 and 0/8 in ECOG PS 3. Toxicity did not differ between different groups. ECOG PS 2-3 patients were more likely to be treated and hospitalized within the last month of life compared to ECOG PS 0-1 patients, RR 1.75 (95\% CI, 1.04-2.56, P = 0.019) and RR 1.73 (95\% CI, 1.10-2.16, P = 0.009), respectively. ECOG PS 2-3 patients were more likely to die in an acute hospital RR 2.68 (95\% CI, 1.17-6.51, P = 0.016). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with poor baseline PS have a significantly lower OS and reduced response to anti-PD1. Further quality of life and palliative care research is needed.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the accuracy of clinical staging, to assess survival with surgical resection alone, and to determine factors associated with understaging in patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma thought to have limited local-regional disease. BACKGROUND: Primary surgical resection is the preferred treatment in patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma clinically staged to have limited nodal disease. This approach requires reliable clinical staging. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed of all patients who had primary esophagectomy for clinical stage T1-3 N0-1 adenocarcinoma (seventh edition AJCC) from January 2002 to May 2013. Clinical and pathologic stages were compared and overall survival was analyzed. RESULTS: There were 88 patients who met inclusion criteria. Final pathology confirmed appropriate clinical staging ({$\leq$}T3N1) in 76\% of patients (67/88). There were 21 patients who were understaged ({$>$}T3N1), and in all cases, understaging was based on the presence of advanced nodal (N2 or N3) disease. Factors independently associated with understaging were the presence of dysphagia, tumor length {$>$}3{$\mkern1mu$}cm, and poor differentiation. At a median follow-up of 35 months, 63\% of all patients (55/88) remain alive. The 5-year survival in correctly staged patients was 67\%, compared with 33\% for those who were understaged (P {$<$} 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Modern clinical staging will accurately identify the majority of patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma and limited local-regional disease ({$\leq$}pT3N1). Survival with surgery alone in correctly staged patients was excellent and unlikely to be improved with neoadjuvant therapy. A combination of dysphagia, poor differentiation, and tumor length {$>$}3{$\mkern1mu$}cm was associated with understaging in 92\% of patients. Patients with these factors are likely to have more advanced disease than clinically suspected and may benefit from neoadjuvant therapy before resection.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Sarcopenia and cachexia are associated with pancreatic cancer and serve as important adverse prognostic factors. Body composition can be analyzed by routine computed tomography (CT) for cancer staging and has been used to study many types of cancer. The CT measurements are robust, but the diagnostic criteria for sarcopenia vary among different studies. Age, sex and race are important factors that affect muscle and fat masses. This study aimed to analyze the effect of different sarcopenia diagnostic criteria on the prognosis of patients with pancreatic cancer. METHODS: Patients with newly diagnosed pancreatic cancer at National Taiwan University Hospital between October 2013 and October 2016 were retrospectively reviewed in this study. Body composition was assessed using cross-sectional CT images to calculate the total skeletal muscle (TSM) index. The concordance and interobserver variability of the TSM measurements were evaluated using both the Western criteria and the Eastern criteria. Kaplan-Meier analyses and the Cox proportional hazard ratio with two different diagnostic criteria for sarcopenia were used to compare the effect on overall survival (OS). RESULTS: A total of 146 patients with pancreatic cancer were enrolled. The TSM index measured by the Western institute was highly correlated with that measured by the Eastern institute (r~=~0.953, p~{$<~$}0.001). The prevalence of sarcopenia in the patient group at baseline was 66.4\% (97/146) by the Western criteria and 11.0\% (16/146) by the Eastern criteria, and only low agreement was found between the Western and Eastern criteria (Kappa value~=~0.028, p~=~0.149). Patients who were sarcopenic by the Western criteria showed no significant difference in OS versus those who were not sarcopenic (p~=~0.807). However, patients who were sarcopenic by the Eastern criteria showed a significant difference in OS versus those who were not sarcopenic in a univariate analysis (p~=~0.008) and multivariate analysis after adjustment for AJCC stage (p~=~0.014). CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that different diagnostic criteria may result in different diagnoses and that sarcopenia is an important poor prognostic factor for pancreatic cancer when appropriate diagnostic criteria are selected.},

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the association of medical and demographic characteristics with muscle abnormalities among patients with nonmetastatic CRC. METHODS: Patients with stage I-III invasive CRC (2006-11) who had diagnostic computed tomography (CT) available from Kaiser Permanente Northern California electronic medical records were included. CT-assessed sarcopenia and low SMD were defined according to optimal stratification. Logistic regressions including age, stage, site, total adipose tissue (TAT), race/ethnicity, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, smoking history, alcohol use, and Charlson Comorbidity Score were performed to identify characteristics associated with muscle abnormalities. RESULTS: The study included 3262 patients (49.9\% females) with a mean {$\pm$} SD age of 62.6 {$\pm$} 11.4 y. Sarcopenia and low SMD were highly prevalent (42.4\% and 29.6\%, respectively). Age and sex interactions were noted for muscle mass, but not SMD. Age was associated with higher odds of muscle abnormalities in a dose-response manner. Compared with those aged {$\leq$}50 y, patients aged 70-80 y had considerably higher odds (OR: 6.19; 95\% CI: 4.72, 8.11) of sarcopenia, and low SMD (OR: 17.81; 95\% CI: 11.73, 27.03). High TAT was related to a higher odds of low SMD (OR: 9.62; 95\% CI: 7.37, 12.56), but lower odds of sarcopenia (OR: 0.59; 95\% CI: 0.48, 0.71). Compared with Caucasians, African Americans had lower odds of sarcopenia and low SMD. Patients with a higher neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio had higher odds of having both muscle abnormalities. Patients who were smokers or had any comorbidity had higher odds of low SMD, but not sarcopenia. CONCLUSIONS: Muscle abnormalities were common in patients with nonmetastatic CRC, with great variability in muscle mass and SMD across age, TAT, and race/ethnicity. Factors associated with muscle abnormalities may be used to facilitate risk stratification and the guidance of targeted strategies to counteract these abnormalities.},

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This population-based retrospective cohort study was conducted among 1630 patients who received a diagnosis of stage I to III colon cancer from January 2006 to December 2011 at Kaiser Permanente Northern California, an integrated health care system. Preliminary data analysis started in 2017. Because major complication data were collected between 2018 and 2019, the final analysis using the current cohort was conducted between 2019 and 2020. EXPOSURES Low skeletal muscle index (SMI) and/or low skeletal muscle radiodensity (SMD) levels were assessed using preoperative computerized tomography images. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Length of stay, any complication (Ն1 predefined complications) or major complications (Clavien-Dindo classification score Ն3), 30-day mortality and readmission up to 30 days postdischarge, and overall mortality. RESULTS The mean (SD) age at diagnosis was 64.0 (11.3) years and 906 (55.6\%) were women. Patients with low SMI or low SMD were more likely to remain hospitalized 7 days or longer after surgery (odds ratio [OR], 1.33; 95\% CI, 1.05-1.68; OR, 1.39; 95\% CI, 1.05-1.84, respectively) and had higher risks of overall mortality (hazard ratio, 1.40; 95\% CI, 1.13-1.74; hazard ratio, 1.44; 95\% CI, 1.12-1.85, respectively). Additionally, patients with low SMI were more likely to have 1 or more postsurgical complications (OR, 1.31; 95\% CI, 1.04-1.65) and had higher risk of 30-day mortality (OR, 4.85; 95\% CI, 1.23-19.15). Low SMD was associated with higher odds of having major complications (OR, 2.41; 95\% CI, 1.44-4.04). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Low SMI and low SMD were associated with longer LOS, higher risk of postsurgical complications, and short-term and long-term mortality. Research should evaluate whether targeting potentially modifiable factors preoperatively, such as preserving muscle mass, could reverse the observed negative associations with postoperative outcomes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The prognostic value of supra-clavicular lymph node (SCLN) metastases in esophageal cancer (EC) is still not clear. METHOD: From January 2009 to December 2015, a survival analysis was performed to retrospectively identify the prognostic value of SCLN metastasis on survival on 751 patients with EC treated with definitive chemo-radiotherapy (dCRT). RESULTS: The median follow-up duration for living patients was 56.6 months. The median overall survival (OS) for all patients was 16.6 months. Patients with SCLN metastasis had a much poorer prognosis for OS ({$\chi$}2 = 17.342, P\,{$<$}\,0.001), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) ({$\chi$}2 = 24.793, P\,{$<$} 0.001) and progression-free survival (PFS) ({$\chi$}2 = 25.802, P\,{$<$} 0.001) than those without SCLN metastasis. The same results were found after propensity score matching. Nonetheless, the prognosis of patients with cervical or upper thoracic EC metastasis in SCLN was better than those of patients with middle or lower thoracic EC metastasis in SCLN for OS ({$\chi$}2 = 4.516, P\,= 0.038), DMFS ({$\chi$}2 = 8.326, P\,=\,0.004) and PFS ({$\chi$}2 = 6.255, P\,= 0.012). Univariate analysis showed that gender, middle or lower thoracic EC with SCLN metastasis, tumor length, tumor diameter, concurrent chemo-radiotherapy (CCR) and number of lymph nodes were prognostic factors for PFS. Gender, age, middle or lower thoracic EC with SCLN metastasis, tumor diameter, tumor length, and number of lymph nodes were prognostic factors for DMFS. According to the multivariate analysis, only middle or lower thoracic EC with SCLN metastasis and number of lymph nodes were independent prognostic factors for DMFS and PFS. CONCLUSION: For patients with cervical or upper thoracic EC, metastasis in SCLN should be considered to be regional lymph nodes and treated with curative intent if the total number of lymph nodes is limited. However, for patients with middle or lower thoracic EC, metastasis should be considered to be a higher level N stage or M1 stage, and it is thus necessary to provide consolidation chemotherapy after dCRT.},

  abstract = {Recently, PET response criteria in solid tumors (PERCIST) have been proposed as a new standardized method to assess chemotherapeutic response metabolically and quantitatively. The aim of this study was to evaluate therapeutic response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy for locally advanced esophageal cancer, comparing PERCIST with the currently widely used response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST). METHODS: Fifty-one patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil, adriamycin, and cisplatin), followed by surgery were studied. Chemotherapeutic lesion responses were evaluated using (18)F-FDG PET and CT according to the RECIST and PERCIST methods. The PET/CT scans were obtained before chemotherapy and about 2 wk after completion of chemotherapy. Associations were statistically analyzed between survival (overall and disease-free survival) and clinicopathologic results (histology [well-, moderately, and poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma], lymphatic invasion, venous invasion, clinical stage, pathologic stage, resection level, reduction rate of tumor diameter, reduction rate of tumor uptake, chemotherapeutic responses in RECIST and PERCIST, and pathologic response). RESULTS: There was a significant difference in response classification between RECIST and PERCIST (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, P {$<$} 0.0001). Univariate analysis showed that lymphatic invasion, venous invasion, resection level, pathologic stage, and PERCIST were significant factors associated with disease-free or overall survival in this study. Although multivariate analysis demonstrated that venous invasion (disease-free survival: hazard ratio [HR] = 4.519, P = 0.002; overall survival: HR = 5.591, P = 0.003) and resection level (disease-free survival: HR = 11.078, P = 0.001) were the significant predictors, PERCIST was also significant in noninvasive therapy response assessment before surgery (disease-free survival: HR = 4.060, P = 0.025; overall survival: HR = 8.953, P = 0.034). CONCLUSION: RECIST based on the anatomic size reduction rate did not demonstrate the correlation between therapeutic responses and prognosis in patients with esophageal cancer receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy. However, PERCIST was found to be the strongest independent predictor of outcomes. Given the significance of noninvasive radiologic imaging in formulating clinical treatment strategies, PERCIST might be considered more suitable for evaluation of chemotherapeutic response to esophageal cancer than RECIST.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evidence regarding the association between sarcopenia (skeletal muscle depletion) and outcomes in patients with lung cancer varies across studies. We aimed to systematically review the prognostic value of sarcopenia in lung cancer. METHODS: We searched Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials through July 23, 2018 to identify retrospective or prospective cohort studies. We applied the Quality in Prognostic Studies instrument to assess the risk of bias in individual studies. We examined the heterogeneity and publication bias and performed subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: We included 13 studies (1,810 participants). The pooled prevalence of sarcopenia was 43\%~in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and 52\%~in patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Sarcopenia was associated with a shorter overall survival (OS) in patients with lung cancer (hazard ratio [HR], 2.23; 95\%~CI, 1.68-2.94). This association existed for both NSCLC (HR, 2.57; 95\%~CI, 1.79-3.68) and SCLC (HR, 1.59; 95\%~CI, 1.17-2.14). Sarcopenia was an independent predictor of shorter OS in both stage I-II NSCLC (HR, 3.23; 95\%~CI, 1.68-6.23) and stage III-IV NSCLC (HR, 2.19; 95\%~CI, 1.14-4.24). However, sarcopenia was not an independent predictor of disease-free survival in patients with NSCLC (HR, 1.28; 95\%~CI, 0.44-3.69). CONCLUSIONS: Sarcopenia is highly prevalent in patients with lung cancer (approximately one in two) and an important predictor of impaired OS in patients with SCLC or with different stages of NSCLC.},

  abstract = {Purpose The efficacy of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NCRT) plus surgery for locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remains controversial. In this trial, we compared the survival and safety of NCRT plus surgery with surgery alone in patients with locally advanced ESCC. Patients and Methods From June 2007 to December 2014, 451 patients with potentially resectable thoracic ESCC, clinically staged as T1-4N1M0/T4N0M0, were randomly allocated to NCRT plus surgery (group CRT; n = 224) and surgery alone (group S; n = 227). In group CRT, patients received vinorelbine 25 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) on days 1 and 8 and cisplatin 75 mg/m2 IV day 1, or 25 mg/m2 IV on days 1 to 4 every 3 weeks for two cycles, with a total concurrent radiation dose of 40.0 Gy administered in 20 fractions of 2.0 Gy on 5 days per week. In both groups, patients underwent McKeown or Ivor Lewis esophagectomy. The primary end point was overall survival. Results The pathologic complete response rate was 43.2\% in group CRT. Compared with group S, group CRT had a higher R0 resection rate (98.4\% v 91.2\%; P = .002), a better median overall survival (100.1 months v 66.5 months; hazard ratio, 0.71; 95\% CI, 0.53 to 0.96; P = .025), and a prolonged disease-free survival (100.1 months v 41.7 months; hazard ratio, 0.58; 95\% CI, 0.43 to 0.78; P {$<$} .001). Leukopenia (48.9\%) and neutropenia (45.7\%) were the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events during chemoradiotherapy. Incidences of postoperative complications were similar between groups, with the exception of arrhythmia (group CRT: 13\% v group S: 4.0\%; P = .001). Peritreatment mortality was 2.2\% in group CRT versus 0.4\% in group S ( P = .212). Conclusion This trial shows that NCRT plus surgery improves survival over surgery alone among patients with locally advanced ESCC, with acceptable and manageable adverse events.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Sex, age, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) may affect immune response. However, the association of these factors with the survival benefit of cancer immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To assess the potential sex, age, and ECOG PS differences of immunotherapy survival benefit in patients with advanced cancer. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Scopus were searched from inception to August 31, 2019. STUDY SELECTION: Published randomized clinical trials comparing overall survival (OS) in patients with advanced cancer treated with ICI immunotherapy vs non-ICI control therapy were included. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Pooled OS hazard ratio (HR) and 95\% CI for patients of different sex, age ({$<$}65 and {$\geq$}65 years) or ECOG PS (0 and {$\geq$}1) were calculated separately using a random-effects model, and the heterogeneity between paired estimates was assessed using an interaction test by pooling study-specific interaction HRs. This study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guideline. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The difference in survival benefit of ICIs between sex, age ({$<$}65 vs {$\geq$}65 years), and ECOG PS (0 vs {$\geq$}1), as well as the difference stratified by cancer type, line of therapy, agent of immunotherapy, and immunotherapy strategy in the intervention arm. RESULTS: Thirty-seven phase 2 or 3 randomized clinical trials involving 23\,760 patients were included. An OS benefit of immunotherapy was found for both men (HR, 0.75; 95\% CI, 0.71-0.81) and women (HR, 0.79; 95\% CI, 0.72-0.88); for both younger ({$<$}65 years: HR, 0.77; 95\% CI, 0.71-0.83) and older ({$\geq$}65 years: HR, 0.78; 95\% CI, 0.72-0.84) patients; and for both patients with ECOG PS 0 (HR, 0.81; 95\% CI, 0.73-0.90) and PS greater than or equal to 1 (HR, 0.79; 95\% CI, 0.74-0.84). No significant difference of relative benefit from immunotherapy over control therapy was found in patients of different sex (P\,=\,.25, I2\,=\,19.02\%), age (P\,=\,.94, I2\,=\,15.57\%), or ECOG PS (P\,=\,.74, I2\,=\,0\%). No significant difference was found in subgroup analyses by cancer type, line of therapy, agent of immunotherapy, and immunotherapy strategy in the intervention arm. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This meta-analysis found no evidence of an association of sex, age ({$<$}65 vs {$\geq$}65 years), or ECOG PS (0 vs {$\geq$}1) with cancer immunotherapy survival benefit. This finding suggests that the use of ICIs in advanced cancer should not be restricted to certain patients in sex, age, or ECOG PS categories.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between CT-derived muscle metrics and standardized metrics of sarcopenia in patients undergoing routine CT imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data collected in 443 consecutive patients included body CT, grip strength, usual gait speed, and responses to SARC-F and FRAIL scale questionnaires. Functional and clinical metrics of sarcopenia were acquired at the time of CT. Metrics were analyzed using the diagnostic framework of the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP2). The skeletal muscle index (SMI) and skeletal muscle density (SMD) were measured at the T12 and L3 levels. Statistical methods include linear prediction models and ROC analysis. RESULTS: T12-SMD and L3-SMD in women and T12-SMD and L3-SMI in men show weak but significant (p\,{$<$}\,0.05) predictive value for gait speed, after adjusting for subject age and body mass index. The prevalence of abnormal CT SMI at T12 and L3 was 29\% and 71\%, respectively, corresponding to prevalences of confirmed sarcopenia by EWGSOP2 of 10\% and 15\%, respectively. The agreement of abnormal SARC-F and FRAIL scale screening and EWGSOP2 confirmed sarcopenia was slight to fair (kappa: 0.20-0.28). CT cutpoints, based on EWGSOP2 criteria for abnormal grip strength or gait speed, are generally lower than cutpoints based on normative population data. CONCLUSION: Collection of clinical and functional sarcopenia information at the point of imaging care can be accomplished quickly and safely. CT-derived muscle metrics show convergent validity with gait speed. Only a minority of subjects with low CT metrics have confirmed sarcopenia by EWGSOP2 definition.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: After curative resection, the prognosis of gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma is poor. This phase III trial was designed to evaluate the benefit in overall survival (OS) of perioperative fluorouracil plus cisplatin in resectable gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Overall, 224 patients with resectable adenocarcinoma of the lower esophagus, gastroesophageal junction (GEJ), or stomach were randomly assigned to either perioperative chemotherapy and surgery (CS group; n = 113) or surgery alone (S group; n = 111). Chemotherapy consisted of two or three preoperative cycles of intravenous cisplatin (100 mg/m(2)) on day 1, and a continuous intravenous infusion of fluorouracil (800 mg/m(2)/d) for 5 consecutive days (days 1 to 5) every 28 days and three or four postoperative cycles of the same regimen. The primary end point was OS. RESULTS: Compared with the S group, the CS group had a better OS (5-year rate 38\% v 24\%; hazard ratio [HR] for death: 0.69; 95\% CI, 0.50 to 0.95; P = .02); and a better disease-free survival (5-year rate: 34\% v 19\%; HR, 0.65; 95\% CI, 0.48 to 0.89; P = .003). In the multivariable analysis, the favorable prognostic factors for survival were perioperative chemotherapy (P = .01) and stomach tumor localization (P {$<$} .01). Perioperative chemotherapy significantly improved the curative resection rate (84\% v 73\%; P = .04). Grade 3 to 4 toxicity occurred in 38\% of CS patients (mainly neutropenia) but postoperative morbidity was similar in the two groups. CONCLUSION: In patients with resectable adenocarcinoma of the lower esophagus, GEJ, or stomach, perioperative chemotherapy using fluorouracil plus cisplatin significantly increased the curative resection rate, disease-free survival, and OS.},

We thereby aim to generate a computerized tomography (CT)-based documentation of PALNs and to propose a clinical target volume (CTV) for this region. Methods: Sixty-five patients were enrolled. The epicentre of each PALN was drawn onto an axial CT image of a standard patient with reference to the surrounding anatomical landmarks. A CTV for PALN was generated based on the final result of node distribution, and was evaluated for dosimetric performance in three simulated patients. Results: All the studied 248 LNs were below the level of 1.0 cm above the celiac artery (CA), and 94.76\% were above the bottom of vertebra L3. Horizontally, 93.33\% of the LNs in the celiac level were located within an expansion of 1.5 cm on the CA, and 94.12\% of the LNs in the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) level were within 1.5 cm on the left side of the SMA. Below the SMA, all the LNs were behind the left renal vein, left to the right border of the inferior vena cava, and 98.51\% of the LNs were medial to the lateral surface of the left psoas major. The proposed CTV could cover 92.74\% of the LNs and was dosimetrically feasible. Conclusions: The proposed CTV is the first one to focus on the high-risk area of abdominal failure in LTESCC patients after surgery and can serve as a reference in the adjuvant radiotherapy for LTESCC patients.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Operations on structures in the chest (usually the lungs) involve cutting between the ribs (thoracotomy). Severe post-thoracotomy pain can result from pleural (lung lining) and muscular damage, costovertebral joint (ribcage) disruption and intercostal nerve (nerves that run along the ribs) damage during surgery. Poor pain relief after surgery can impede recovery and increase the risks of developing complications such as lung collapse, chest infections and blood clots due to ineffective breathing and clearing of secretions. Effective management of acute pain following thoracotomy may prevent these complications and reduce the likelihood of developing chronic pain. A multi-modal approach to analgesia is widely employed by thoracic anaesthetists using a combination of regional anaesthetic blockade and systemic analgesia, with both non-opioid and opioid medications and local anaesthesia blockade.There is some evidence that blocking the nerves as they emerge from the spinal column (paravertebral block, PVB) may be associated with a lower risk of major complications in thoracic surgery but the majority of thoracic anaesthetists still prefer to use a thoracic epidural blockade (TEB) as analgesia for their patients undergoing thoracotomy. In order to bring about a change in practice, anaesthetists need a review that evaluates the risk of all major complications associated with thoracic epidural and paravertebral block in thoracotomy. OBJECTIVES: To compare the two regional techniques of TEB and PVB in adults undergoing elective thoracotomy with respect to:1. analgesic efficacy;2. the incidence of major complications (including mortality);3. the incidence of minor complications;4. length of hospital stay;5. cost effectiveness. SEARCH METHODS: We searched for studies in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2013, Issue 9); MEDLINE via Ovid (1966 to 16 October 2013); EMBASE via Ovid (1980 to 16 October 2013); CINAHL via EBSCO host (1982 to 16 October 2013); and reference lists of retrieved studies. We handsearched the Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery and Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (16 October 2013). We reran the search on 31st January 2015. We found one additional study which is awaiting classification and will be addressed when we update the review. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing PVB with TEB in thoracotomy, including upper gastrointestinal surgery. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors (JY and SG) independently assessed the studies for inclusion and then extracted data as eligible for inclusion in qualitative and quantitative synthesis (meta-analysis). MAIN RESULTS: We included 14 studies with a total of 698 participants undergoing thoracotomy. There are two studies awaiting classification. The studies demonstrated high heterogeneity in insertion and use of both regional techniques, reflecting real-world differences in the anaesthesia techniques. Overall, the included studies have a moderate to high potential for bias, lacking details of randomization, group allocation concealment or arrangements to blind participants or outcome assessors. There was low to very low-quality evidence that showed no significant difference in 30-day mortality (2 studies, 125 participants. risk ratio (RR) 1.28, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.39 to 4.23, P value = 0.68) and major complications (cardiovascular: 2 studies, 114 participants. Hypotension RR 0.30, 95\% CI 0.01 to 6.62, P value = 0.45; arrhythmias RR 0.36, 95\% CI 0.04 to 3.29, P value = 0.36, myocardial infarction RR 3.19, 95\% CI 0.13, 76.42, P value = 0.47); respiratory: 5 studies, 280 participants. RR 0.62, 95\% CI 0.26 to 1.52, P value = 0.30). There was moderate-quality evidence that showed comparable analgesic efficacy across all time points both at rest and after coughing or physiotherapy (14 studies, 698 participants). There was moderate-quality evidence that showed PVB had a better minor complication profile than TEB including hypotension (8 studies, 445 participants. RR 0.16, 95\% CI 0.07 to 0.38, P value {$<$} 0.0001), nausea and vomiting (6 studies, 345 participants. RR 0.48, 95\% CI 0.30 to 0.75, P value = 0.001), pruritis (5 studies, 249 participants. RR 0.29, 95\% CI 0.14 to 0.59, P value = 0.0005) and urinary retention (5 studies, 258 participants. RR 0.22, 95\% CI 0.11 to 0.46, P value {$<$} 0.0001). There was insufficient data in chronic pain (six or 12 months). There was no difference found in and length of hospital stay (3 studies, 124 participants). We found no studies that reported costs. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Paravertebral blockade reduced the risks of developing minor complications compared to thoracic epidural blockade. Paravertebral blockade was as effective as thoracic epidural blockade in controlling acute pain. There was a lack of evidence in other outcomes. There was no difference in 30-day mortality, major complications, or length of hospital stay. There was insufficient data on chronic pain and costs. Results from this review should be interpreted with caution due to the heterogeneity of the included studies and the lack of reliable evidence. Future studies in this area need well-conducted, adequately-powered RCTs that focus not only on acute pain but also on major complications, chronic pain, length of stay and costs.},

  author = {Yoon, Saunjoo L and Kim, Jung A and Kelly, Debra Lynch and Lyon, Debra and George, Thomas J},
  pages = {10},
  abstract = {Background Unintentional weight loss is a major problem for patients with gastrointestinal (GI) cancers because it affects treatment, survival outcomes, and quality of life. To date, little is known about the trajectory of weight loss and the relationship between baseline body mass index (BMI), location of the cancer, and outcomes. The aims of this study were to investigate patterns of weight loss over time in patients with GI cancer according to BMI groups (low, normal, and high) and location of cancer. Methods We examined de-identified electronic medical record data of 801 adults ({$>$}21 years) with GI cancer using ICD-9 codes (150\textendash 159). Descriptive statistics and linear mixed models were used to examine unintentional weight loss over time by BMI group (low, normal, and high) and to determine the effect of primary cancer site and patient characteristics on weight loss. Results The mean age of patients was 66.5 {$\pm$} 11.9 years (21\textendash 95 years), with 58\% male and 86\% White. Mean weight loss over 3 years was 21.39 kg. At the first observation point, 7.8\% were in the low BMI group, 30.1\% were in the normal, and 62\% were in the high group. At the end of observation, a majority of deaths (35.5\%) occurred in the low BMI group (BMI {$<$} 20 kg/m2). Significant weight loss was observed in patients with gastric (t = \`A5.11, P {$<$} 0.001), oesophageal (t = \`A4.18, P {$<$} 0.001), and pancreatic (35.8\%, t = \`A3.58, P {$<$} 0.001) cancers. Predictors of weight change were gender (F = 64.93, P {$<$} 0.001), cancer stage (F = 7.28, P {$<$} 0.001), and site by days (F = 8.24, P {$<$} 0.001). Weight loss rates were similar among the three BMI groups, but patterns were different based on primary cancer type as a function of days within each group. Conclusions Weight loss in patients with GI cancers has implications for survival. Patients with upper GI cancers experienced more weight loss and decreased survival rates compared with patients with lower GI cancers. Patients with a combination of upper GI cancer (oesophagogastric or pancreatic) and low baseline BMI had the fewest survival days and worst patient outcomes. Early intervention for weight management plays a critical role for improving the health outcomes and fatality rates of these patients.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Sarcopenia has been widely recognized as an important predictor of poor outcomes in patients with cancer after surgery, but the controversy remains, and its impact on surgical and oncologic outcomes in patients after abdominal surgery for digestive tract cancer is poorly described. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic impact of sarcopenia on surgical and oncologic outcomes in patients after abdominal surgery for digestive tract cancer. METHODS: Six thousand four hundred and forty-seven consecutive patients who underwent abdominal surgery for digestive tract cancer in our institution were prospectively included. Sarcopenia was defined as skeletal muscle index below the lowest sex-specific quartile using computed tomography scan at L3 before surgery. The surgical and oncologic outcomes were recorded, and univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. RESULTS: Sarcopenia was present in 1638 of 6447 patients (25.4\%) with digestive tract cancer before surgery based on the diagnostic cut-off values (43.13~cm2/m2 for men and 37.81~cm2/m2 for women). The incidence of postoperative total and pulmonary complications, and 30-day readmission were significantly higher in sarcopenic group than in nonsarcopenic group (37.4\% vs 12.9\%, P~{$<~$}0.001; 3.1\% vs 2.1\%, P~=~0.026; 1.1\% vs 0.4\%, P~=~0.003, respectively). The postoperative hospital stay was significantly longer in sarcopenic patients (9.42~{$\pm~$}3.40 vs 8.51~{$\pm~$}3.17 days, P~{$<~$}0.001). There were significantly more patients receiving postoperative chemotherapy or radiotherapy in sarcopenic group than in nonsarcopenic group (73.1\% vs 69.2\%, P~=~0.003; 10.6\% vs 8.8\%, P~=~0.038, respectively), and patients with sarcopenia had significantly more chemotherapy modifications including delay, dose reduction, or termination (48.5\% vs 44.2\%, P~=~0.018). In addition, during the follow-up period, sarcopenic patients had significantly lower rate of overall survival and disease-free survival than nonsarcopenic patients (53.9\% vs 69.3\%, P~=~0.002; 36.8\% vs 59.7\%, P~=~0.000, respectively). In multivariate analysis, sarcopenia was found to be a risk factor for postoperative complications [odds ratio (OR)~=~5.418, 95\% confidence interval (CI)~=~2.986-9.828, P~{$<~$}0.001], and was an unfavorable prognostic factor for poor overall survival [hazard ratio (HR)~=~0.649, 95\% CI~=~0.426-0.991, P~=~0.045] and disease-free survival (HR~=~0.514, 95\% CI~=~0.348-0.757, P~=~0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Sarcopenia could be used as a strong and independent prognostic factor for poor surgical and oncologic outcomes in patients after abdominal surgery for digestive tract cancer. Identification of preoperative sarcopenia in digestive surgery for cancer and targeted approaches may improve its negative outcomes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Body mass index (BMI) has been associated with the risk of oesophageal cancer. But the influence of BMI on postoperative complication and prognosis has always been controversial. METHODS: In total, 2031 consecutive patients who underwent oesophagectomy between 1998 and 2008 were classified according to Asian-specific BMI (kg\,m(-2)) cutoff values. The impact of BMI on overall survival (OS) was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard models. We performed a meta-analysis to examine the association of BMI with OS and postoperative complication. RESULTS: Patients with higher BMI had more postoperative complication (P=0.002), such as anastomotic leakage (P=0.016) and cardiovascular diseases (P{$<$}0.001), but less incidence of chylous leakage (P=0.010). Logistic regression analysis showed that BMI (P=0.005) was a confounding factor associated with postoperative complication. Multivariate analysis showed that overweight and obese patients had a more favourable survival than normal weight patients (HR (hazard ratio) = 0.80, 95\% CI (confidence interval): 0.70-0.92, P=0.001). Subgroup analysis showed that the association with higher BMI and increased OS was observed in patients with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) (P{$<$}0.001), oesophageal adenocarcinoma (EA) (P=0.034), never-smoking (P=0.035), ever-smoking (P=0.035), never alcohol consumption (P=0.005), weight loss (P=0.003) and advanced pathological stage (P{$<$}0.001). The meta-analysis further corroborated that higher BMI was associated with increased complication of anastomotic leakage (RR (risk ratio)=1.04, 95\% CI: 1.02-1.06, P=0.001), wound infection (RR=1.03, 95\% CI: 1.00-1.05, P=0.031) and cardiovascular diseases (RR=1.02, 95\% CI: 1.00-1.05, P=0.039), but decreased incidence of chylous leakage (RR=0.98, 95\% CI: 0.96-0.99, P{$<$}0.001). In addition, high BMI could significantly improved OS (HR=0.78, 95\% CI: 0.71-0.85, P{$<$}0.001). CONCLUSION: Preoperative BMI was an independent prognostic factor for survival, and strongly associated with postoperative complications in oesophageal cancer.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The benefit of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for treating cancer of the esophagus or the gastroesophageal junction remains controversial. In the present study, we conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis to examine the efficacy of these two management strategies. METHODS: The MEDLINE (PubMed), SinoMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for eligible studies. We searched for the most relevant studies published until the end of September 2017. Data were extracted independently and were analyzed using RevMan statistical software version 5.3 (Cochrane Collaboration, http://tech.cochrane.org/revman/download). Weighted mean differences, risk ratios (RRs), and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool was used to assess the risk of bias. In this comprehensive meta-analysis, we examined the efficiency of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for the treatment of cancer of the esophagus or the gastroesophageal junction as reported in qualified clinical trials. RESULTS: Six qualified articles that included a total of 866 patients were identified. The meta-analysis showed that for 3-year and 5-year survival rates in primary outcomes, the results favored neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy strategies compared with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (RR = 0.78, 95\% CI = 0.62-0.98, P = 0.03; RR = 0.69, 95\% CI = 0.50-0.96, P = 0.03, respectively). In terms of secondary outcomes, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy significantly increased the rate of R0 resection and pathological complete response as well (RR = 0.87, 95\% CI = 0.81-0.92, P {$<$} 0.0001; RR = 0.16, 95\% CI = 0.09-0.28, P {$<$} 0.00001, respectively). However, there were no significant differences in postoperative mortality between the two groups (RR = 1.85, 95\% CI = 0.93-3.65, P = 0.08). For the results of postoperative complications, revealed that there was a statistically significant difference between the two groups in the incidence of postoperative complications such as pulmonary, anastomotic leak and cardiovascular complications. The subgroup analysis of patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma showed that both esophageal adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma patients achieved a high rate of R0 resection (RR = 0.85, 95\% CI = 0.77-0.93, P = 0.0006; RR = 0.88, 95\% CI = 0.81-0.96, P = 0.005, respectively) and pathological complete response benefit of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (RR = 0.23, 95\% CI = 0.09-0.57, P = 0.001; RR = 0.18, 95\% CI = 0.03-0.96, P = 0.05, respectively). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggested that compared with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy should be recommended with a significant long-term survival benefit in patients with cancer of the esophagus or the gastroesophageal junction. In view of the clinical heterogeneity, whether these conclusions are broadly applicable should be further determined.},

  abstract = {Some controversy surrounds the postoperative feeding regimen utilized in patients who undergo esophagectomy. Variation in practices during the perioperative period exists including the type of nutrition started, the delivery route, and its timing. Adequate nutrition is essential for this patient population as these patients often present with weight loss and have altered eating patterns after surgery, which can affect their ability to regain or maintain weight. Methods of feeding after an esophagectomy include total parenteral nutrition, nasoduodenal/nasojejunal tube feeding, jejunostomy tube feeding, and oral feeding. Recent evidence suggests that early oral feeding is associated with shorter LOS, faster return of bowel function, and improved quality of life. Enhanced recovery pathways after surgery pathways after esophagectomy with a component of early oral feeding also seem to be safe, feasible, and cost-effective, albeit with limited data. However, data on anastomotic leaks is mixed, and some studies suggest that the incidence of leaks may be higher with early oral feeding. This risk of anastomotic leak with early feeding may be heavily modulated by surgical approach. No definitive data is currently available to definitively answer this question, and further studies should look at how these early feeding regimens vary by surgical technique. This review aims to discuss the existing literature on the optimal route and timing of feeding after esophagectomy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Long-term survival outcomes of trimodal therapy (TMT; chemoradiation plus surgery) and bimodal therapy (BMT; chemoradiation) have seldom been analysed. In a selective-surgery paradigm, the benefit of TMT in patients with a complete clinical response is controversial. Factors associated with survival in patients with a clinical complete response to chemoradiation were evaluated. METHODS: Patients with stage II-III oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma treated with TMT or BMT from 2002 to 2017 were evaluated. The BMT group consisted of patients who were otherwise eligible for surgery but underwent chemoradiation alone followed by observation. This group included patients who later had salvage oesophagectomy. Survival was evaluated and compared between TMT and BMT groups. Elastic net regularization was performed to select co-variables for Cox multivariable survival analysis in patients with a clinical complete response. RESULTS: Of 143 patients, 60 (41.9 per cent) underwent TMT and 83 (58.0 per cent) BMT. Patients who underwent TMT had longer median overall survival than those who had BMT (77 versus 33\,months; P\,=\,0.019). For patients with a clinical complete response, TMT achieved longer median overall survival than BMT (123 versus 55\,months; P\,=\,0.04). BMT had a high locoregional recurrence rate (48 versus 6 per cent; P\,{$<$}\,0.001); 26 of 29 patients with locoregional recurrence in the BMT groupunderwent salvage resection. Cox multivariable analysis demonstrated that upper-mid oesophageal tumour location (hazard ratio (HR) 2.04; P\,=\,0.024) and tumour length (HR 1.18; P\,=\,0.046) were associated with worse survival. Although TMT was not associated with survival, it was a predictor of reduced recurrence (HR 0.28; P\,=\,0.028). The maximum standardized uptake value after chemoradiation also predicted recurrence (HR 1.33; P\,{$<$}\,0.001). CONCLUSION: In patients who achieve a clinical complete response, TMT reduces locoregional recurrence but may not prolong survival. The differences in survival outcomes may be due to patient selection; therefore, a selective-surgery strategy in oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma is a reasonable approach.},

However, it is unknown whether MIO has superiority in reducing the occurrence of in-hospital mortality (IHM). OBJECTIVE: The objective of this meta-analysis was to explore the effect of MIO vs. OE on the occurrence of in-hospital mortality (IHM). DATA SOURCES: Sources such as Medline (through December 31, 2014), Embase (through December 31, 2014), Wiley Online Library (through December 31, 2014), and the Cochrane Library (through December 31, 2014) were searched. STUDY SELECTION: Data of randomized and non-randomized clinical trials related to MIO versus OE were included. INTERVENTIONS: Eligible studies were those that reported patients who underwent MIO procedure. The control group included patients undergoing conventional OE. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: Fixed or random -effects models were used to calculate summary odds ratios (ORs) or relative risks (RRs) for quantification of associations. Heterogeneity among studies was evaluated by using Cochran's Q and I2 statistics. RESULTS: A total of 48 studies involving 14,311 cases of resectable oesophageal cancer were included in the meta-analysis. Compared to patients undergoing OE, patients undergoing MIO had statistically reduced occurrence of IHM (OR=0.69, 95\%CI =0.55 -0.86). Patients undergoing MIO also had significantly reduced incidence of pulmonary complications (PCs) (RR=0.73, 95\%CI = 0.63-0.86), pulmonary embolism (PE) (OR=0.71, 95\%CI= 0.51-0.99) and arrhythmia (OR=0.79, 95\%CI = 0.68-0.92). Non-significant reductions were observed among the included studies in the occurrence of anastomotic leak (AL) (OR=0.93, 95\%CI =0.78-1.11), or Gastric Tip Necrosis (GTN) (OR=0.89, 95\%CI =0.54-1.49). LIMITATION: Most of the included studies were non-randomized case-control studies, with a diversity of study designs, demographics of participants and surgical intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Minimally invasive oesophagectomy (MIO) has superiority over open oesophagectomy (OE) in terms of the occurrence of in-hospital mortality (IHM) and should be the first-choice surgical procedure in esophageal surgery.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To estimate the modifying effect of age on the survival benefit associated with adjuvant chemotherapy receipt in elderly patients with a diagnosis of Stage III colon cancer. DESIGN: Observational, retrospective cohort study using two samples: an overall sample of 7,182 patients to provide externally valid analyses and a propensity score-matched sample of 3,016 patients to provide more internally valid analyses by reducing the presence of treatment endogeneity. An interval-censored survival model with a complementary log-log link was used. Hazard ratios and 95\% confidence intervals were obtained for all regressions. SETTINGS: Data from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database and the linked Medicare enrollment and claims database were used. PARTICIPANTS: Selected patients were aged 66 and older and had a diagnosis of Stage III colon cancer. Patients were followed from surgery to time of death or censorship. MEASUREMENTS: The outcome was colon cancer-specific death during the follow-up period. Receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy was measured according to the presence of a claim for 5-fluorouracil or leucovorin within 6 months after surgery. RESULTS: All elderly patients had a significant survival benefit associated with adjuvant chemotherapy receipt, although the survival benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy was not uniform across all age groups. CONCLUSION: These findings have important clinical and policy implications for the risk-benefit calculation induced by treatment in older patients with Stage III colon cancer. The results suggest that there is a benefit from chemotherapy, but the benefit is lower with older age.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Current guidelines for gastrointestinal cancer surgical intervention in high-risk patients recommend postoperative venous thromboembolism (VTE) chemical prophylaxis for 4 weeks with low-dose unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin, but specific guidelines for esophagectomy are lacking. This survey identified the clinical patterns affecting postesophagectomy VTE chemoprophylaxis use among general thoracic surgeons. METHODS: General Thoracic Surgery Club members were invited to complete an online survey on VTE prophylaxis to analyze clinical factors affecting their choices. RESULTS: Seventy-seven surgeons (37\% membership) responded; of these, 94\% (72 of 77) completed fellowships, and 76\% (58 of 77) worked at universities. VTE chemoprophylaxis administration varied widely in drug, dosing, and duration, with 30\% using suboptimal dosing of unfractionated heparin (every 12 hours). Participants agreed that esophagectomy patients are at high VTE risk, yet 29\% (22 of 76) of surgeons delay VTE chemoprophylaxis until postoperative day 1. Only 13\% (10 of 77) prescribe postdischarge chemoprophylaxis. Minimally invasive surgeons ({$>$}90\% of cases) were more likely to prescribe postdischarge prophylaxis (p~= 0.007). Epidurals, routinely used by 65\% (51 of 78), led to less compliance with recommended dosing. Only 53\% (27 of 51) of pain teams allow unfractionated heparin every 8~hours, yet 73\% (37 of 51) allow suboptimal dosing (every 12 h). Postoperative major complications were identified as a VTE risk factor by only 21\% (15 of 72) of surgeons. Most (92\% [68 of 74]) would follow esophagectomy-specific guidelines, if developed. CONCLUSIONS: Thoracic surgeons agree that VTE chemoprophylaxis is necessary for esophagectomy, yet substantial variability exists in current practice. A noteworthy proportion use suboptimal dosing, and very few choose postdischarge prophylaxis. To improve postesophagectomy morbidity and mortality outcomes, thoracic surgeons are willing to follow evidence-based guidelines for VTE chemoprophylaxis.},
